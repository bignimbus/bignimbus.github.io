    "summary": "My coworkers would describe me as outgoing, personable and passionate about user interfaces. Developing software is hard and expensive, but conversation is easy and cheap. In the planning process, I try to be a part of the conversation early to get a handle on the business case for the feature. This helps me deliver software that has the highest impact at the lowest cost possible.  As a former teacher and musician, I know how important communication and creativity are to the success of the team. An ideal role would put me in a position to mentor, manage, and recruit teammates while shipping features to production.",
