    "summary": "My coworkers would describe me as outgoing, personable and passionate. In the planning process, I try to be a part of product decision-making early to get a handle on the business case for the feature. This helps me deliver software that has the highest impact at the lowest cost possible, anywhere on the stack. While crafting software, I often refer to prior art when justifying design choices.\n\nAs a former teacher and musician, I know how important communication, defined roles, and creativity are to the success of the team. I've managed a small engineering team successfully using these principles. An ideal position would combine IC and leadership responsibilities.",
