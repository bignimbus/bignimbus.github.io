    "summary": "My colleagues would describe me as outgoing, personable and passionate about great software and frictionless user interfaces. Developing software is hard and expensive, but conversation is easy and cheap. In the planning process, I try to be a part of the conversation early to get a handle on the business case for the feature. This helps my team deliver software that has the highest impact at the lowest cost possible.  As a former teacher and musician, I know how important communication and creativity are to the success of the group. This has been a key influence on my style as a manager, mentor, and contributor to a variety of projects across a variety of systems during my tenure at Visibly.",
