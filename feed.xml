        <title>Using Git to run ESLint on changed files in a feature branch</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/git-lint.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using Git to run ESLint on changed files in a feature branch&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lied a bit in the title: this works for any static analysis tool.
So if you&amp;#39;re a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rubocop.org/&quot;&gt;RuboCop&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pylint.org/&quot;&gt;Pylint&lt;/a&gt;,
or [insert awesome static analysis util here] user, this solution
has you covered.  The impetus for this post was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot;&gt;ESLint&lt;/a&gt;,
though, so I&amp;#39;ll use that for the sake of a specific example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself in the unenviable position of trying to introduce
a new linter rule.  The reason this was such a pain was because
there were over 4,000 violations in our codebase, and this particular
rule didn&amp;#39;t have an automated fix available.  The manual fix wasn&amp;#39;t
just a matter of style, either &amp;mdash; it would require regression-testing
every module it touched.  That&amp;#39;s out of the question.  Ignoring the
error was impossible, too, because our CI build runs &lt;code&gt;eslint&lt;/code&gt; against
all of our frontend code.  And making it a warning would not sufficiently
incentivize the team to fix the underlying issues this rule is supposed
to police.  What to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transitional-config&quot;&gt;Transitional config&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I set up a &amp;quot;transitional&amp;quot; config file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# .eslintrc.transitional&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;./.eslintrc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;my-new-rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this extends our existing configuration, adding just one
modification.  To ensure that any text editor integrations register
the rule so that it&amp;#39;s visible, I also modified the main config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# .eslintrc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;my-new-rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;warn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the groundwork is there.  Next, I set up a new script in
&lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;lint:transitional&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;eslint -c ./.eslintrc.transitional&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-git-diff&quot;&gt;Using git diff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the secret sauce: in the same CI build step as where we run
&lt;code&gt;eslint&lt;/code&gt; against our entire frontend codebase, I added a step
where we run &lt;code&gt;lint:transitional&lt;/code&gt; only on files that have been
changed in that particular branch.  &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# get a list of js/ts files that are different from master&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# at the merge-base&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DIFFED_FILES_TO_LINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git diff master... &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name-only&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;*.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;*.tsx&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;*.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;*.jsx&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# execute eslint with the &quot;transitional&quot; rules&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# only on touched files.&lt;/span&gt;
yarn lint:transitional &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$DIFFED_FILES_TO_LINT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more info on that &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; command, check out this
&lt;a href=&quot;https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=git+diff+master...my-branch+--name-only+--+%22*.ts%22+%22*.tsx%22+%22*.js%22+%22*.jsx%22&quot;&gt;explainshell&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20808892/git-diff-between-current-branch-and-master-but-not-including-unmerged-master-com/20809283#20809283&quot;&gt;This StackOverflow answer&lt;/a&gt;
is also illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-that-accomplish&quot;&gt;What did that accomplish?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now introduce a painful but ultimately helpful new rule 
gradually.  When a team touches a file with which they are
familiar, paying down the technical debt pointed out by the new
rule becomes a matter of necessity.  Since (presumably) developers
are only touching files that are relevant to the work they are
shipping, the chance of a regression is lower than it would be if
some intrepid but less-familiar engineer took it upon themselves
to try to update the whole code base at once.  The total number
of violations will gradually decrement, and so too will the
as-of-now unknown pain points that may be associated with fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pop-Punk: a vim color scheme</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/pop-punk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pop-Punk: a vim color scheme&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using the vim text editor for a while now.  I
know some basic
&lt;a href=&quot;https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/&quot;&gt;vimscript&lt;/a&gt;,
but not much more.  A while ago, I settled on a version of
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gkjgh/cobalt&quot;&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt; color scheme
as my theme of choice.  I made a few tweaks here and there
over the course of a few years.  It started to become more
noticeably painful to change colors after a while - sometimes
I&amp;#39;d update a hex color and forget to update the corresponding
cterm value.  And as I got deeper into customizing my terminal,
I got deeper into tweaking my vim setup.  So I decided it was
high time to solidify all the tweaks I made into a coherent
color scheme (with a matching airline theme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bignimbus/pop-punk.vim&quot;&gt;pop-punk.vim&lt;/a&gt;:
a dark, high-contrast color scheme that retains a sense of
fun and character.  If you&amp;#39;re a vim user, I&amp;#39;d love to hear
what you think of it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Principles for an Effective Distributed Team</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/home-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Principles for an Effective Distributed Team&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2020 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/70-percent-of-people-globally-work-remotely-at-least-once-a-week-iwg-study.html&quot;&gt;people work from home&lt;/a&gt;.  The benefits are intuitive: commutes are often risky and can be a waste of time and natural resources; plus removing geographical barriers can increase the size of the recruitment pipeline.
Even though some companies are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/07/11/535398716/some-employers-are-rethinking-telework-citing-a-need-for-better-collaboration&quot;&gt;making headlines by bucking that trend&lt;/a&gt;,
remote working is a fact of life.  People get sick; they make appointments during business hours; they want to keep their heads
down and focus away from their sometimes-distracting office; they want to catch up before or after hours on something important
to their work.  Face it: your teams needs to be able to function outside of a centralized workplace.  Whether your team is entirely
distributed, completely on-site, or some hybrid thereof, try to mind these principles to empower your team for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;principles-for-teams&quot;&gt;Principles for Teams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web has made physical distance less meaningful than ever before in human history.  This means that teams have the power to
work in ways that were impossible a generation ago.  With this great power
comes great responsibility, and that responsibility must not fall exclusively on those who happen to be working outside of the space
where most of the team works.  Before reading, take stock of what kind of team you&amp;#39;re working with: are there any teammates,
vendors or consultants working off-site?  How many?  How often do teammates work from home?  With these facts in mind, consider the
principles below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manage-availability-and-expectations&quot;&gt;Manage Availability and Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teammates need to know what to expect of one another.  It&amp;#39;s easy to tell when someone is away from their desk in person,
but folks working off-site have no easy way to peek over at someone&amp;#39;s desk and figure out their immediate availability,
and vice versa.  Ensure teammates are aware of each other&amp;#39;s work hours by keeping shared calendars updated.  Don&amp;#39;t be distant on
instant messenger either: status messages or quick FYIs are a great way to keep everyone&amp;mdash;regardless of location&amp;mdash;aware
of when someone&amp;#39;s working and when they&amp;#39;re not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your team evaluates teammates in a way that could &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; penalize someone who is off-site, consider reworking those criteria.
A results-oriented evaluation system will support work habits that empower all teammates to succeed regardless of their
latitude and longitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drop-bread-crumbs&quot;&gt;Drop Bread Crumbs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Silo&amp;quot; is a dirty word in the workplace.  Teams should avoid balkanizing their communications wherever possible.  Informal chats
about &lt;em&gt;Product A&lt;/em&gt; in the break room can quickly turn into actionable work.  An instant message chain in a small channel can snowball
into a full-blown spec in no time.  The simple solution?  Take notes!  Sharing a photo of the back of a napkin or a quick email
summary can help keep the team abreast of developments that will impact their work.  This sort of artifact generation also comes in
handy months or even years later when trying to retrace the evolution of a product or feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;invest-in-telepresence&quot;&gt;Invest in Telepresence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio/video quality directly impacts communication quality.  Invest in the right hardware and software in
order to minimize potential disruptions and maximize comprehension.  Set aside a few minutes before a video conference to make
sure that the camera and microphone are set up and working.  Teammates shouldn&amp;#39;t wait for others in a teleconference to
tell them that they can&amp;#39;t be heard or seen&amp;mdash;beginning a meeting with &amp;quot;can you see and hear me?&amp;quot; makes a world of difference.
Ideally, the answer is &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; but if not, everyone needs to pitch in (within reason) in order to troubleshoot and resolve the problem.
This can be burdensome, but it&amp;#39;s far less disruptive than an information deficit that leads to a defect in the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As important as A/V quality is, telepresence is not the same as physical prescence.  In fact, telepresence is a skill that can be
cultivated and improved with enough care and attention.
Keeping the camera and
microphone on is a good practice, but don&amp;#39;t be alarmed or judgmental of teammates who switch off sometimes.  There&amp;#39;s a difference
between being physically together in the same space and having your head on a large-screen television for all to see up-close.
To avoid falling into the trap of &amp;quot;multitasking&amp;quot; and other attention-draining activities during video conferences, try not touching
the computer at all.  Note-taking or even idle doodling could be an effective way of practicing mindful telepresence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bond&quot;&gt;Bond&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spontaneity and shared experiences are the foundation for meaningful human connections.  There&amp;#39;s no reason why these ideals
can&amp;#39;t be met digitally!  Team instant message channels could ensure there&amp;#39;s a space for unplanned, not-necessarily-work-related
fun.  Keeping an open-invitation video conference is a nice way for collegues to digitally &amp;quot;visit&amp;quot; each other&amp;#39;s work places.  Team
outings are a great way to bond, but try to balance out those activities with location-independent events.  Internet games, book clubs,
and fantasy sports are just a few ways to be geographically inclusive.  Scheduling one-on-one conversations with teammates you&amp;#39;ll never
physically &amp;quot;bump into&amp;quot; in a shared office is a great way to nurture connections (even if your teammate isn&amp;#39;t your &amp;quot;work friend&amp;quot;).
Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to use video chat just to say hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-inclusive&quot;&gt;Be Inclusive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When teammates work across more than one work space, it&amp;#39;s imperative that everyone pitch in to make it work.  Investments in
a distributed workforce will benefit the whole team, even if most or all workers are on-site most of the time.  Build a lexicon
of non-judgmental terms to foster inclusivity.  Instead of being &amp;quot;at home,&amp;quot; teammates are &amp;quot;in the cloud.&amp;quot;  Instead of
&amp;quot;spending&amp;quot; time getting the new conference room microphone set up, &amp;quot;invest&amp;quot; that time.  Teammates don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;get to&amp;quot; work from
home&amp;mdash;it&amp;#39;s not a personal favor&amp;mdash;they&amp;#39;re just working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working outside of a central office is easier when teammates understand what to expect.  If teammates are encouraged to occasionally
work from home, it&amp;#39;s likely that they will understand the needs of off-site teammates more.  Another strategy would be to
hold an &amp;quot;all-remote&amp;quot; meeting where all attendees&amp;mdash;even if most of them are in the same
office&amp;mdash;join a teleconference individually.  This will help build empathy amongst teammates by putting everyone on equal
footing with regards to telepresence.  The quality of the A/V might be surprising too: one microphone and one camera per person
can do wonders for communication clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the team is spread across more than one time zone, there are two rules that must be followed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always mind the time zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously, always mind the time zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mealtimes will vary.  Mind that, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tips-for-remote-workers&quot;&gt;Tips for Remote Workers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are suggestions for someone working off-site, even if it&amp;#39;s only for a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practice-self-care&quot;&gt;Practice Self-Care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dont-guilt-yourself&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#39;t guilt yourself&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working remotely has pros and cons for yourself and the team.  There&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; way to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;take-breaks&quot;&gt;Take breaks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat a meal, drink a beverage, exercise, take a walk, do something to take care of your mind and body.
When the end of the day comes, make sure you&amp;#39;ve done at least one thing other than sitting at your workstation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;embrace-being-a-head-in-a-box&quot;&gt;Embrace being a head in a box&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer you&amp;#39;re out of a central workplace, the more you become associated with whatever electronic communciation media
your team uses.  You&amp;#39;re basically a head in a box; don&amp;#39;t fight it!  Have fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintain-professional-relationships&quot;&gt;Maintain professional relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re working from home, it&amp;#39;s easy to neglect your professional network/community.  If you can&amp;#39;t go to meetups or other events
physically, there are ways to stay &amp;quot;in the loop&amp;quot; with people and ideas in your industry.  Seek and cultivate those opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structure-your-time-and-space&quot;&gt;Structure Your Time and Space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;commute-to-work&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Commute&amp;quot; to work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boundaries between personal and work time can help you protect the former and focus on the latter.  Maintain two daily rituals before
and after work hours to structure your day: a workout, a walk, an errand, a coffee run, taking the kids to/from school, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;have-a-designated-work-space&quot;&gt;Have a designated work &amp;quot;space&amp;quot;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of an office needs to be adapted in order to apply to remote work.  Whether you set up shop in your
single-family home five days a week or travel the world in a van, guerilla-working from wherever you can find the
best coffee and wifi, crafting an office can be a great way to tacitly enforce boundaries
between work and life.  In 2020, your office is not necessarily a physical area; it can be a state of mind.
If you work from your home, avoid regularly working in areas reserved for eating, sleeping, or leisure.  Those
spots can be great for taking a one-on-one or for an occasional change of scenery, but they are too tightly coupled
with your personal life for routine productivity.  Strive to find a location other than your dining table to get
things done on a regular basis.  If your locale changes regularly, try to find something to help trick your brain
into perceiving an &amp;quot;office.&amp;quot;  For some, simply starting at a fixed time of day is a good way to mentally tag
their &amp;quot;office.&amp;quot;  For others, wearing a certain pin or other accessory during business hours may do the trick.
Whatever your solution, make your &amp;quot;office&amp;quot; something that consistently differentiates work time from the other
parts of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-be-a-stranger&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Be a Stranger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;make-time-for-relationships&quot;&gt;Make time for relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go out of your way&amp;mdash;schedule it if you must&amp;mdash;to connect and reconnect with colleagues.  Keep in mind, though, that
staying connected is a shared responsibility.  Don&amp;#39;t shoulder everything yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;see-and-be-seen&quot;&gt;See and be seen&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t turn off your camera during video conferences unless you need to, and do your best to participate in situations that
haven&amp;#39;t been optimized for videoconferencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maintain-professionalism&quot;&gt;Maintain Professionalism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-dressed&quot;&gt;Get dressed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even pants.  You might think you&amp;#39;re only visible from the shoulders up, but just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;master-your-communication-apps&quot;&gt;Master your communication apps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get to know your instant message, video conference, and VOIP apps better than anyone.  Learn how to troubleshoot efficiently.
Become a power user to minimize technical difficulties and maximize utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;be-available&quot;&gt;Be available&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all messages can be returned right away&amp;mdash;teammates won&amp;#39;t always mind your status/away message or check your calendar
before sending an IM your way.  Find ways to respond, even if it&amp;#39;s a triage message, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, I&amp;#39;m in meetings all afternoon so I can get focus on this starting around 4:00pm Eastern Time.  In the meantime, I think
Charlie might be able to help out.  I&amp;#39;m setting a reminder for myself now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;children-and-animals&quot;&gt;Children and animals...&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... can be welcome &amp;quot;guest stars&amp;quot; on camera.  They can also be a distraction.  Always be mindful of the context and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Methodical UI: removing frustration from HTML and CSS development</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/car-mirror.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Methodical UI: removing frustration from HTML and CSS development&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;re a developer.  Maybe you&amp;#39;re a designer.  Maybe
you&amp;#39;re a software project manager.  Chances are that you&amp;#39;re dealing with
at least a bit of HTML and/or CSS during a typical work week.  What&amp;#39;s
your workflow for that? If you&amp;#39;re like most honest people, your answer
is: &amp;quot;it depends.&amp;quot;  In the past, my workflow looked a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do another thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thing 1 is messed up so I need to do it again but differently now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust spacing on thing 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way I was gonna do the next thing is now not going to work for some reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a fantastic idea, it&amp;#39;s gonna work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;42. Done! Just don&amp;#39;t ask how&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this sounds familiar? If it&amp;#39;s working for you, that&amp;#39;s great! The
rest of this article is probably not for you. But if you&amp;#39;re tired of tying your
virtual shoelaces together, there are two ways to make this process less painful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get better at HTML and CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure your workflow to minimize having to go back and fix things that were working fine before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 1 will work very well. Fluency with HTML and CSS will grant you much more
command over the web browser and reduce the amount of times you run into
dead ends in the development process. Improving your skills will also facilitate quick
recovery from setbacks. But absent
a reliable workflow, setbacks are still inevitable. In the swirling vortex of uncertainty
that is user interface development, a structured approach is the key to sustainable,
predictable, and manageable progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-html-and-css-can-be-so-frustrating&quot;&gt;Why HTML and CSS can be so frustrating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get one thing out of the way: coding can be frustrating no matter what you&amp;#39;re
trying to build.  HTML and CSS, though, are frustrating in ways that are distinct
from other software-creation tasks.  And that frustration isn&amp;#39;t unique to a single
type of worker.  If you&amp;#39;re used to creating interfaces in a
GUI or WYSIWYG such as those provided by Adobe, InVision, and others, using a text
editor in order to express your ideas may feel cumbersome and opaque.
If you&amp;#39;re
a software developer, you may be more comfortable creating things that operate
in a world of black-and-white: either the program works according to spec or it
doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, coding in HTML and CSS produces a
formatted, styled document; coding in a programming language produces a program.
Because these media are so different, it&amp;#39;s only natural that folks who have put
a lot of time into the latter might find the former to feel like a chore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say programming isn&amp;#39;t difficult. Seasoned professionals can
struggle for months trying to turn
input X into output Y.  At the end of the day, though, programmers can
rely on tools such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end
tests in order to remove uncertainty from the creative process.  If your
test suite is well-written and all the tests pass, then the team can be
fairly confident that the program meets its requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML and CSS offer no such comfort. Robust test suites for
validating colors, fonts,
positioning, and other peculiar aspects of user interfaces simply don&amp;#39;t exist. Just as
da Vinci couldn&amp;#39;t ask a machine whether &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/em&gt; was ready for the public - though I&amp;#39;m
sure he probably sketched such a machine at some point - UI developers must also determine
the correctness of their work by manually inspecting it. Instead of a single canvas, however,
we must check our work on a variety of media, any or all of: phones, tablets, laptops,
desktops, screen readers, smart TVs and game consoles. The lack of computable acceptance
criteria and the diversity of media that can view a hypertext document makes
HTML and CSS a frustratingly imprecise art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reason to despair, though. Despite HTML and CSS&amp;#39;s limitations, we can borrow
ideas from programming best practices in order to add structure to the UI development
process. Whether you&amp;#39;re a dyed-in-the-wool front-end developer,
a hobbyist, a designer who dabbles, or a project manager that needs to ship an A/B test every
now and then, a methodical approach can keep you reasonably certain that the code you&amp;#39;re
writing now is not messing up the code you&amp;#39;ve already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-need-to-know&quot;&gt;What you need to know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A methodical approach to HTML and CSS development rests on a foundational understanding of
CSS&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property. I cannot overstate how important this concept is. As a quick
refresher, here&amp;#39;s to what I&amp;#39;m referring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.my-element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; is one of many possible values that can be assigned to an element&amp;#39;s
&lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property, we will focus on &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; (including &amp;quot;block-like&amp;quot;)
elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inline-elements&quot;&gt;Inline elements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inline elements can be simply described as &amp;quot;linear.&amp;quot; By default, they will take as much
horizontal space as necessary until reaching the maximum width allowed by their container,
at which point they will overflow into a line break (by default). Conceptually, inline
elements have no set height or width; instead, they will take up only the space that
they require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      async=on
      alt=&quot;horizontal rectangles wrapping to two lines&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/inline.svg&quot;
      style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 350px;&quot;
    /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
        A representation of inline content wrapping to a new line
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;block-elements&quot;&gt;Block elements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block elements are not linear; in fact, they are rectangles. As such, they often behave
more intuitively than inline elements in the web browser, which is an inherently
two-dimensional medium. These types of elements are the ones that respect
the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model&quot;&gt;CSS box model&lt;/a&gt;:
they have defined width, height, positioning, and spacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      async=on
      alt=&quot;horizontal rectangles wrapping to two lines&quot;
      src=&quot;https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13647/box-model-standard-small.png&quot;
      style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 500px;&quot;
    /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
        The CSS Box Model.&lt;br&gt;
        Attribution: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model&quot;&gt;Mozilla Contributors&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;caveat-emptor&quot;&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that was simple, right? Inline is &lt;em&gt;like a line&lt;/em&gt; and block is &lt;em&gt;like a box&lt;/em&gt;. As a
reminder, though: there
are many other possible values for &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt;. A few possibilities include:
&lt;code&gt;inline-block&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;inline-flex&lt;/code&gt;.
These types of elements, however, will
generally fall under one of the two semantic categories we previously discussed.
According to the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#the-display-properties&quot;&gt;W3C spec&lt;/a&gt;, CSS3&amp;#39;s
&lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property is overloaded. There are &lt;em&gt;inner display types&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;outer display types&lt;/em&gt;. In most cases, your favorite &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; value is actually &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; on
the outside and something else on the inside (&lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt; is the poster child for this).
To complicate things further, there are six types of &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt;
values: outside, inside, listitem, internal, box, and legacy. Please feel free to spend
the rest of your day nerding out inside the W3C spec but we have a job to do, so
let&amp;#39;s move on. Suffice it to say that, despite the diversity in the CSS3 specification for
&lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt;, boiling down our process to &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; elements is sufficient for all
but the most arcane of edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inline-vs-block-idioms&quot;&gt;Inline vs. block idioms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said before that understanding inline vs. block is the foundational principle of this method.
Now let&amp;#39;s dive a little deeper into the types of properties that are idiomatic of these
elements, then we&amp;#39;ll unpack what this means for your user interface development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table id=&quot;idiomatic-properties-of-element-types&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Idiomatic properties of element types:&lt;/strong&gt;
      &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;
        Inline
      &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;
        Block
      &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;font*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;line-height&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;letter-spacing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;text-decoration&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;background-color&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bottom | left | right | top&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;margin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;padding&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;text-align&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what do we mean when we say &amp;quot;idiomatic?&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s not like you can&amp;#39;t declare a &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;
inside a block-level element, after all. The big idea to take away from this
not-at-all-exhaustive chart is that block-level elements should be selected for styles
that target properties of boxes, and inline-level elements should be selected for styles
that target properties of lines of content (usually text). Adding non-idiomatic
styles to a given element will create conditions that are ripe for having to go back
and fix something later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buttons-media-and-form-elements-are-block-elements&quot;&gt;Buttons, media, and form elements are block elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You heard me.  User agents typically give these types of elements specialized
&lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; values, but developers should be wary of passively accepting these
browser-assigned defaults.  Since we expect images, inputs, and videos to have
height, width, and to behave predictably in a layout that supports multiple screen
sizes, the only sensible course of action is to treat these elements as plain
ol&amp;#39; block elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      async=on
      alt=&quot;CSS values displayed in the dev tools element inspector&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/ua-stylesheet.jpg&quot;
      style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 500px;&quot;
    /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
        Chromium 76 UA stylesheet values for an HTML button
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methodical-ui-in-seven-steps&quot;&gt;Methodical UI in seven steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our inline vs. block distinction fresh in our minds, let&amp;#39;s walk through seven steps
that will guide us through UI development using HTML and CSS with minimal frustration.
For the purposes of this example, I will be using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html&quot;&gt;React with JSX&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#39;s very similar to HTML so hopefully nothing gets lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-spec&quot;&gt;Example spec&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using this simple design comp as our &amp;quot;spec&amp;quot; to implement using our seven steps.
Behold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap&quot;&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        async=on
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 300px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Cat with text on a small screen&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/mobile-comp.jpg&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        async=on
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 300px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Cat with text on a large screen&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/desktop-comp.jpg&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;
      Ersatz design comp featuring my cat
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity&amp;#39;s sake, we won&amp;#39;t be listing all the different quantitative values like
&lt;code&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt; - just trust that we&amp;#39;re using the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; values in the following demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-content&quot;&gt;Step 1: Content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get all the content on the page, with the bare minimum of markup necessary.
Media tags and form element tags will be necessary, but nothing more - we
simply want to write no more HTML than is absolutely necessary to display
the elements with which we will be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./pepper.jpg'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Pepper'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Pepper
      Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
      long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
      that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
      joins almost all of them.
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'button'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Pet Pepper
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds simple, but your spec may contain dynamic content. If that is the case with
your feature, the least-disruptive choice would be to hardcode the most complex
content that is possible given the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By getting your final (or one possible version of the final) content all on the page, we
ensure that we are not forgetting anything.  Include any content
that is breakpoint-specific; if something is shown on wide screens but not small screens,
include it on the page here. We can work on media queries and hide/show logic later in
the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-semantics&quot;&gt;Step 2: Semantics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enclose content in semantic HTML tags.  Don&amp;#39;t worry about layout considerations -
this is where we add anchors, headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./pepper.jpg'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Pepper'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Pepper
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
        long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
        that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
        joins almost all of them.
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'button'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Pet Pepper
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we have enclosed the heading text inside an &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; tag and the copy text
inside a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag.  In so doing, we are making strides toward
valid and accessible markup.  These tags will be consistent across all breakpoints,
so there is no need to consider responsiveness at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-layout&quot;&gt;Step 3: Layout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is a bit more involved.  We will organize our semantic markup into the
appropriate layout-oriented tags in order to set ourselves up for success when
we begin adding stylesheets.  Identify which parts of your markup could be considered
headers, sections, footers, navigation elements, articles, etc. and wrap them
in the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Content_sectioning&quot;&gt;appropriate semantic HTML tag&lt;/a&gt;.
Be deliberate about choosing which tag to use, and feel free to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; if no
semantic purpose is evident.  Follow these directives for best results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the smallest supported screen width and don&amp;#39;t worry about CSS yet.  The
page will still look incomplete throughout this step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;media-markup&quot;&gt;Media&lt;/span&gt; and interactive elements such as images,
videos, inputs, and selects
must be wrapped in at least one &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;.  When in
doubt, use more wrappers than necessary.  Positioning media elements can be tricky
down the line, and you&amp;#39;ll be doing yourself a favor by giving yourself some containers
to work with, ensuring the best fit for your media on a variety of screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/foo.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- will be used to position the element in the document flow --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- will be used to constrain / crop / letterbox the media to the desired size --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/foo.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Foo&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Foo&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text nodes must be direct descendants of inline elements and must never be direct
descendants of block elements.  Remember that inline and block elements are fundamentally
different and should be styled as such.  We will style the text content using
a selector given to the &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; (inline) element, and we will style the box surrounding
that text via a selector assigned to the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; (block) element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Foo
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Foo
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For clarity&amp;#39;s sake, &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; is considered a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;text node&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#39;s
not quite an HTML element, but it is an entity inside the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt;.
When I refer to &lt;em&gt;text nodes&lt;/em&gt;, I simply am talking about text content inside
HTML elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibling elements should never have different &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; values.  In other words,
don&amp;#39;t put an &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; element next to a &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- block sibling --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/bar.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- inline sibling --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Bar
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- block sibling --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/bar.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- block sibling --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Bar
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span id=&quot;button-markup&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; must have a direct
descendant that is a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;, and that &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; should
contain all content inside the button.  We will almost always position that &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;
absolutely so that the content of the button doesn&amp;#39;t produce any unexpected layout
changes.  In other words, we&amp;#39;re making sure if the button breaks, nothing
else will break as a result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Tap me
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Tap me
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s our source code so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./pepper.jpg'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Pepper'&lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'button'&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                      Pet Pepper
                    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      async=on
      alt=&quot;screenshot of UI after step 3&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/wip.jpg&quot;
    /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
        Our UI after step 3
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is where we begin using CSS.  Word to the wise: &lt;strong&gt;target
the smallest supported screen size only&lt;/strong&gt; during this and subsequent
steps.  We will add styles for larger screen sizes eventually, but
this method works best when you complete your small-screen styles first
and then work your way up to the largest supported screen size.  This
encourages the developer to confine larger-screen styles inside media
query scopes, thus reducing the likelihood of having to modify
previously-written code that was working properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-style-inline-elements&quot;&gt;Step 4: Style inline elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the smallest supported screen size only, ensure all inline elements are
styled according to the specification.  Font properties, letter spacing,
line heights, and colors are all fair game.  The
&lt;a href=&quot;#idiomatic-properties-of-element-types&quot;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; earlier in this article
is a useful resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are targeting only these types of styles, it should become more
apparent why we enclose all text nodes inside a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;heading&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Hello world!
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.heading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;36px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;letter-spacing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By putting nine rules inside the &lt;code&gt;.heading&lt;/code&gt; selector, we have
obscured its purpose.  Both the descendant inline text node and
its containing &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; block are being styled and are therefore
coupled with one another unnecessarily.  We can resolve this issue
by adding a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;heading&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text text--xl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Hello world!
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--xl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;36px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;letter-spacing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.heading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making our selectors more terse and separating the concerns of
inline vs block styles, we make the stylesheet more readable in a
way that suggests an intuitive markup structure.  In other words,
I can read the HTML and have a good clue as to what the CSS is like
and I can read the CSS and have a good clue as to what the HTML is
like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that principle in mind, let&amp;#39;s take a look at our source code
now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./pepper.jpg'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./App.css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Pepper'&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--copy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--lg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;24px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-style-media-and-interactive-elements&quot;&gt;Step 5: Style media and interactive elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttons, images, videos, inputs, selects, and other types of interactive
elements aren&amp;#39;t inline elements, nor are they used to structure larger
layout patterns like some of the more conventional block elements.
Because these elements are so crucial to building web applications, they
can also be finicky and inconsistent from browser to browser.  Be sure to
follow the guidelines set forth earlier in this article with regard to
&lt;a href=&quot;#button-markup&quot;&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#media-markup&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; markup structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting down into the details of all the possibilities here might make this
already-long article even longer, so I will save that subtopic for a
future post.  Image/media positioning is a fairly well-tread subject in the
community so I&amp;#39;m confident you as the reader will navigate that successfully.
I would, however, like to get in a word about buttons.  As a refresher,
let&amp;#39;s take a look at a sample button:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;button__content-container&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text text--white text--sm&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Tap Me
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like an awful lot of pomp for a simple button.  But what happens
if we simplify it?  I mean, how bad could the following be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text text--white text--sm&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Tap Me
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in what happens with your dynamic content, and our conceptual
modeling of what a &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; actually represents.  Consider this set of styles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;appearance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#00f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;24px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--white&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would work fine for the time being.  But what happens if you change
the size of &lt;code&gt;.text--sm&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;16px&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;17px&lt;/code&gt;?  How would that affect the
rendered height of your &lt;code&gt;.button&lt;/code&gt; or the positioning of the text inside of
it?  Even if you are fluent in CSS, your code doesn&amp;#39;t make the answer clear
to the reader, which is a warning sign that you might end up inadvertently
breaking a layout down the line.  That&amp;#39;s why we have the extra &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; inside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;appearance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#00f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;24px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* wraps the text content */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button__content-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our &lt;code&gt;.button__content-container&lt;/code&gt; is absolutely positioned and
centered, any
change in its descendant elements will not affect the layout of &lt;code&gt;.button&lt;/code&gt;.
Whether it&amp;#39;s dynamic content or a change in font-size or spacing, the
absolutely-positioned container gives us an insurance policy against
accidental breakage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that note, let&amp;#39;s inspect our source code after step 5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-6-style-block-elements&quot;&gt;Step 6: Style block elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may notice that we have &amp;quot;started small.&amp;quot;  First, text nodes;
then, some larger and more complex elements.  This is intentional:
layouts cannot be adequately styled if their consituent elements
are not styled.  Many a developer, including myself, have tied
their shoelaces together by styling their layouts before locking down
the final dimensions of the content itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the smallest supported screen size&lt;/em&gt;, ensure your layout-oriented
block elements are styled with the appropriate values for positioning,
padding, margins, flex values, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our source code so far:&lt;/p&gt;

                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your UI should now appear pixel-perfect on the smallest screen
size you support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        async=on
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 400px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Cat with text on a small screen&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/mobile-comp.jpg&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;
      Pepper on a small screen
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-7-repeat-for-each-breakpoint&quot;&gt;Step 7: Repeat for each breakpoint&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through
&lt;a href=&quot;#step-4-style-inline-elements&quot;&gt;step 4&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;#step-5-style-media-and-interactive-elements&quot;&gt;step 5&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&quot;#step-6-style-block-elements&quot;&gt;step 6&lt;/a&gt;
again at each specified breakpoint.  Our example spec has a
single breakpoint, but many designs will specify layouts for
mobile phone-sized screens, tablet-sized screens, laptop-sized
screens, and maybe one for extra-wide screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, since we are certain our styles for our smallest screen
work as expected, we can nest all subsequent styles inside a
media query and be confident that none of the work we&amp;#39;ve done
so far will be affected by this step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* approx. width of portrait-oriented tablet */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;screen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;768px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* will not affect anything we've already done! 🎉 */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;18px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button__container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        async=on
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 300px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Cat with text on a large screen&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/desktop-comp.jpg&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;
      Pepper on a large screen
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve finished this process for all supported screen sizes,
the next step is up to your judgment.  If your content is dynamic,
you&amp;#39;ll want to make sure that your
dynamism is implemented and test your new UI with a
cross-section of possible content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you been checking your UI in multiple browsers throughout this
process?  If not, better fire up Safari and IE and get to work now
before you deploy your 🔥 HTML and CSS to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by incrementally turning raw content into idiomatic,
valid, and accessible markup.  Inline content was properly enclosed
in &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;s and/or other appropriate elements.  Block content was duly
enclosed in one of the many different types of tags that HTML5 gives
us for a number of purposes.  Block-like elements such as inputs
and images were coerced into becoming block elements with their own
purpose-driven, self-contained layouts within.  Support for
progressively wider screen sizes was incrementally added inside of
media query scopes so as to avoid introducing regressions into our
source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any simplified example, real-world workflows will necessarily
vary with the types of interfaces the developer is working on.  The
principles set forth in this article, though, will provide a sensible
guideline for safeguarding against common frustrations endemic
to front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-it-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping it up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am eager to
learn whether this process has helped anyone in real life, so please
don&amp;#39;t hesitate to reach out and start a dialogue on what&amp;#39;s working
and what isn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to acknolwedge
&lt;a href=&quot;http://josephalfonso.com/&quot;&gt;Joseph Alfonso&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s
contributions - his perspective helped to polish the prose
in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

I obliged him, and learned a lot about TLA+ in the process!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth a read:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gino's East Deep Dish Pizza Imitation Recipe</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/deep-dish-pizza.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gino's East Deep Dish Pizza Imitation Recipe&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I moved out of Chicago, I&amp;#39;ve missed Gino&amp;#39;s East pizza.  In particular, I loved indulging in their classic deep dish with spicy sausage and green peppers.  Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong&amp;mdash;the New York metro area has amazing pizza, but deep dish is basically non-existant.
I&amp;#39;ve been spending the past year or so trying to make a convincing facsimile of the Gino&amp;#39;s recipe at home.  I cross-referenced at least a dozen recipes from various corners of the internet.  None of them got it right.  The best recipe I found was a clipping that a coworker shared with me from a recipe book of his.  But that recipe still fell short on the crust.
As of this past weekend, however, I am finally confident that I&amp;#39;ve crafted a recipe that is every bit as delicious, if not a bit more labor-intensive, than the average slice of Gino&amp;#39;s East fresh out of their ovens.  Here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-recipe&quot;&gt;The Recipe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makes two 9&amp;quot; deep dish pizzas.  If you are prepping constantly, it takes about two hours minimum.  Add some extra time if this is your first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hardware-etc&quot;&gt;Hardware, etc.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 cake/pie pans, 9&amp;quot; each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 large bowls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 sauce pan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cheese grater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plastic wrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 skillet (if sausage is a topping)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 brush (optional, but makes life easier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dough-ingredients&quot;&gt;Dough ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 packet OR 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup cornmeal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons corn oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 teaspoon sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(set aside the corn oil bottle, you will need some extra later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sauce-ingredients&quot;&gt;Sauce ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 can (28 oz) San Marzano tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 garlic cloves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup grated onion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh basil and/or oregano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dried oregano, to taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dried basil, to taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground black pepper, to taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt, to taste (kosher salt recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 teaspoon sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cheese-and-toppings&quot;&gt;Cheese and toppings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 lb fresh mozzarella cheese, grated. Don&amp;#39;t use the cheap stuff, don&amp;#39;t use pre-shredded, for the love of everything holy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup parmesan and/or asiago, grated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bell pepper (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 package of spicy Italian sausage (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really anything else you can think of, but I usually limit it to sausage and peppers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-the-dough&quot;&gt;Make the dough&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine the flour, cornmeal, and salt in a big bowl. Heat up 1 cup of water so that it&amp;#39;s not hot, but not room temperature either. Get it warm. Transfer the water into a small bowl. Stir the yeast and sugar into the water. You&amp;#39;ll know the yeast is active when the mixture begins to foam and bubble&amp;mdash;that will take about 5-10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfer the water/yeast/sugar mixture into a separate big bowl. Add the corn oil. Wash your hands and thoroughly dry them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly add the flour/cornmeal/salt mixture into the wet bowl. Stir the mixture with one hand, using the other to keep the bowl stable. Keep the gooey stuff off the sides of the bowl, trying to keep as much of the mixture together as one blob. It will start to congeal. Once the dry stuff is integrated into the blob, add more. The dough is ready to rise when it&amp;#39;s moist, but not sticky. Add flour if it&amp;#39;s too sticky, add water if it&amp;#39;s too dry. Knead the dough for a few minutes, but you don&amp;#39;t have to get carried away with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bowl that held the dry stuff is now empty. Using a brush, or your hand, coat the inside of the bowl with corn oil. Pat the dough into a ball, then put it inside the bowl. Cover completely with plastic wrap and set aside to let rise at room temperature for 45-60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-the-sauce&quot;&gt;Make the sauce&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crush the San Marzano tomatoes in a big bowl. Chop the garlic. Chop the fresh herbs. Grate the onion - use the largest holes to avoid it being too soupy. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Once melted, add onion and fresh herbs and cook until liquid is evaporated and the onion is golden brown. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, maximum 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and sugar, increase heat to high and bring to a simmer. Then bring the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 20-30 minutes (about 2 1/2 cups should remain after the sauce reduces). Turn off the heat, and stir in olive oil, dried herbs, pepper, and salt to taste. Let sit, stirring every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 425 degrees, rack on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prep-the-toppings&quot;&gt;Prep the toppings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grate the cheeses. Cut any toppings to your liking. Keep in mind that any topping pieces should be cut into smaller pieces, 1&amp;quot; diameter tops. Otherwise the pizza&amp;#39;s texture makes it hard to get a good sauce/cheese/topping ratio each bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sausage, you should cook it in advance. Heat a (preferably cast-iron) skillet to medium, add your cooking spray of choice if needed, brown the sausage for 5 minutes on both sides, turning often. Add 1/2 cup water, cover the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and let simmer for 15 minutes. Cut the sausage into 1/2 - 1&amp;quot; bits.

    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ginos-east-deep-dish-pizza-imitation-recipe/adding-the-toppings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;two pans with dough and cheese. One has sausage and peppers in it&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Cheese and toppings first: literally the opposite of most other pizza styles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ginos-east-deep-dish-pizza-imitation-recipe/adding-the-sauce.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;two pans with sauce on top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;If you need to spread the sauce around manually, don&amp;#39;t be shy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assemble-the-pizzas&quot;&gt;Assemble the pizzas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a brush or your hand, line each deep dish with corn oil. Don&amp;#39;t be shy. Sprinkle some corn meal onto your work surface. Take the risen dough out of the bowl and separate into two equal halves. For each half, on your prepared surface, hand-flatten and roll out to be as large as your dishes, plus a few inches in diameter. It&amp;#39;s easier to make it too wide than not wide enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each half, transfer the flattened dough to a deep dish. Use your fingers to conform the dough to the contour of the dish, and use your thumbs to make sure that the dough goes all the way up the side of the dish without falling over the edge. Presentation counts, try to clean up any &amp;quot;hills and valleys&amp;quot; at the edges - the dough&amp;#39;s edge should be as smooth as the curve of the dish. Try to repair any holes in the dough. Brush the dough with corn oil - not too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprinkle the grated mozzarella evenly on the dough. Next, add any toppings. Then, add the sauce and spread evenly over the top of all the cheese and toppings. Sprinkle the parmesan/asiago on top, to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cook&quot;&gt;Cook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cook for 25-35 minutes on the bottom rack at 425 degrees. The pizza is done when the mozzarella bubbles up to the top. Let sit for two minutes before serving.

        <title>If Bach Wrote Never Gonna Give You Up</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/bach-rick.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;If Bach Wrote Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around
And desert you
- Stock Aitken Waterman, as performed by Rick Astley
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague, Dan, recently changed our conference call hold music to Rick Astley&amp;#39;s 1987 hit, &amp;quot;Never Gonna Give You Up.&amp;quot;  Little did he know that I had been sitting on an almost-finished homage to Mr. Astley for the better part of two years.  A new job and a new child later, I&amp;#39;ve finally put the finishing touches on &amp;quot;If Bach Wrote.... Never Gonna Give You Up.&amp;quot;  I take great pleasure in being able to do a completely original Rick Roll of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;full-audio&quot;&gt;Full audio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-original&quot;&gt;The original&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-this-series&quot;&gt;About this series&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who aren&amp;#39;t familiar, this piece is part of a series of fugues called &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/tag/ifbachwrote&quot;&gt;If Bach Wrote&lt;/a&gt;.  The premise is simple: extract a memorable tune (or tunes) from pop music with minimal alteration, and write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue&quot;&gt;fugue&lt;/a&gt; with that tune as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.northern.edu/wieland/theory/form/fugue.htm&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a three-voice fugue in the key that Astley sang it: A-flat major (!?).  I made one key modification: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature&quot;&gt;time signature&lt;/a&gt;.  Instead of the standard 4/4 time signature, I opted to go with 3/8.  It just sounds more like a Baroque dance this way, and allowed me to take advantage of the &amp;quot;bouncy&amp;quot; nature of the rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;themes&quot;&gt;Themes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose the melody of the chorus as a subject:
&lt;figure class=&quot;music&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/if-bach-wrote-never-gonna-give-you-up/subject.png&quot; alt=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;bass clef; Ab major&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue#The_exposition&quot;&gt;tonal answer&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;figure class=&quot;music&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/if-bach-wrote-never-gonna-give-you-up/answer.png&quot; alt=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;treble clef; Ab major&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue#The_exposition&quot;&gt;countersubjects&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;figure class=&quot;music&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;bass clef; Ab major&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;passages-of-note&quot;&gt;Passages of note&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm78: the subject is stated in double augmentation, and several times thereafter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm133: the subject is stated in B-flat minor with a B-flat pedal tone in voice III&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tonal-outline&quot;&gt;Tonal outline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm1: A-flat major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm34: F minor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm43: A-flat major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm51: D-flat major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm78: E-flat major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm99: F minor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm121: A-flat major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm124: D-flat major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm133: B-flat minor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mm160: A-flat major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>A few uses for JavaScript generator functions</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/factory-1311075-1279x850.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A few uses for JavaScript generator functions&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many modern browsers and runtimes are in substantial compliance with the ECMAScript2015 spec.  One of my favorite new additions to JavaScript in ES2015 is the generator function.  The expressive capabilities of these functions are significant.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2ality.com/2015/03/es6-generators.html&quot;&gt;Axel Rauschmayer wrote a great, in-depth article&lt;/a&gt; discussing generators, what they are, and how they can be used in JavaScript.  For those who are pretty comfortable using generators, this next part is for you.  Here are a couple of tricks, along with some basic examples of how they might be relevant to a modern JavaScript application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;composing-large-data-structures-with-generators&quot;&gt;Composing large data structures with generators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional structures such as arrays and objects can use lots of memory when the data set is unconventionally large.  Here&amp;#39;s an array containing every possible latitude and longitude on Earth, incremented by 0.1.  For those who can&amp;#39;t count that fast, that&amp;#39;s an array of 6,485,401 arrays of two floating-point numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getCoords&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;coords&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;coords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;parseFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;parseFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;coords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chromium v. 52.0.2707.0 (64-bit), the coords array took up roughly half a gigabyte of memory.  Here&amp;#39;s the same data, expressed as a generator function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;coords&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;parseFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;parseFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same browser, this took up about one kilobyte of memory.  Because generator functions are evaluted only when they are incremented, you avoid having to store all of your data in memory.  This is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2015/03/09/lazy-evaluation-of-generators-in-es6.aspx&quot;&gt;lazy evaluation&lt;/a&gt;, and it is key to understanding the fundamental difference between generators and traditional JavaScript objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iterating over millions of data points will still consume considerable CPU resources, but the savings in memory can open up new possibilities.  The above code snippet is a generalized use case, but you may find the lazy evalution paradigm to be indispensible when working with large data sets on the client or in Node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recursion-in-generators&quot;&gt;Recursion in generators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to use recursion inside a generator function with the use of the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; sigil after your &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; statement.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield*&quot;&gt;MDN goes into more detail&lt;/a&gt; on how this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lyrics&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'du'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'hast'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'mich'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;90s industrial metal fans* rejoice!  Again, this is a simple example for demonstration purposes.  I&amp;#39;m working on something at the moment that will help demonstrate the power of this pattern, but it&amp;#39;s not quite finished yet.  More to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;custom-iterators&quot;&gt;Custom iterators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re making an app that is a calendar of concerts at which 90s industrial metal bands* are playing.  The API response contains an array of objects, each object representing a concert that is happening in the current calendar year.  Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;data&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;timestamp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1461875683&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;timestamp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1487453724&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;bands&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;nine inch nails&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;location&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;41.8851600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;-86.6607320&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s parse this data structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concerts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concerts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// pretend we have a template for this example&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concerts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be simple enough to put a comparison inside your template or in your parse function to only display dates that are in the future, but where&amp;#39;s the fun in that?  Let&amp;#39;s compose an object with an iterator instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concertFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concerts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Symbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concerts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concerts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concertFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concerts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concerts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why choose this option over &lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.map&lt;/code&gt;?  In many cases, the difference is negligible and it comes down to a matter of taste.  Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I want to preserve the original data structure without redundancy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do your users need up-to-the-second updates?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answer to either of these questions is &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; consider using generator functions to compose custom iterators over your data set.  Speaking to point 1, composing an iteration protocol will conform to data immutability best practices.  Say you want to show 90s industrial metal fans* the total number of concerts for a calendar year; all you need to do is get the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; of the source data set, which has not changed.  Point 2 is all about &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the iterator is invoked.  &lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.map&lt;/code&gt; callbacks are put into the event loop immediately.  Generators, on the other hand, are lazy-evaluted: the date comparison happens at the precise moment your app renders the data.  In a reactive template or socket.io app, this may be a relevant concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* DISCLAIMER: I am not a 90s industrial metal fan&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>If Bach Wrote Oops!... I Did It Again</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/bach-britney.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;If Bach Wrote Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t un-see that image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Oops!...I did it again  

I played with your heart, got lost in the game  

Oh baby, baby  

Oops!...You think I'm in love  

That I'm sent from above  

I'm not that innocent&quot;  

      - Britney Spears  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my teen years I was too busy listening to Limp Bizkit to notice the hidden gem in Britney&amp;#39;s 2000 hit, &amp;quot;Oops!... I Did It Again.&amp;quot; Now, no one will ever repeat that fateful mistake again. You&amp;#39;re welcome, America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;triumphant-return&quot;&gt;Triumphant Return&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for my long hiatus on new posts - lots of new and exciting things are happening in my personal life right now and I&amp;#39;ve had to put writing on the back burner for a bit. But enough about me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/tag/ifbachwrote&quot;&gt;If Bach Wrote...&lt;/a&gt; (IBW) is a personal project of mine where I regularly pick an iconic tune from pop culture, extract melodic material from it, and compose a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue&quot;&gt;fugue&lt;/a&gt; with that melody as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.northern.edu/wieland/theory/form/fugue.htm&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve tackled &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/music/if-bach-wrote-dont-stop-believin&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/music/if-bach-wrote-turn-down-for-what&quot;&gt;Lil Jon&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;#39;ve been pretty surprised with the large audience both pieces have acquired (relative to what I&amp;#39;m used to). If you&amp;#39;ve listened to those two pieces, thank you! Who knew that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony&quot;&gt;polyphony&lt;/a&gt; could still be popular in the 21st century?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-original&quot;&gt;The Original&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bubblegum pop is often given the cold shoulder by musicologists, but the refrain of &amp;quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&amp;quot; makes for a fascinating fugue subject. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/HMUDVMiITOU&quot;&gt;Listen here&lt;/a&gt; - you can skip to 0:50 to hear the refrain, but you&amp;#39;d be missing out on some slick bass playing by Thomas Lindberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece is a rare five-voice fugue, meaning there are up to five independent melodies happening in parallel. Most composers hesitate to write five-voice fugues (Bach only has a handful to his name): they tend to border on a &amp;quot;chorale&amp;quot; like sound, which can sound overly &amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot; and suffer from a lack of true polyphony. On top of that, most fugue subject are either too busy or have to wide of a tonal range to accommodate for five voices. &amp;quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&amp;quot; is slow enough (I slowed it down to 60bpm) and compact enough (within a sixth) that I decided to throw caution to the wind and give five voices a shot. Here&amp;#39;s what the subject looks like on paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/legacy/bach-oops-subject.png&quot; alt=&quot;IBW Oops I Did It Again Subject&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subject, in C# minor: i V i VII III i E: V I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue#The_exposition&quot;&gt;tonal answer&lt;/a&gt; is in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_key&quot;&gt;relative major&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/legacy/bach-oops-answer.png&quot; alt=&quot;IBW Oops I Did It Again Answer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer, in E major: I V I vi c#: iidim V&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exposition makes use of two &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue#The_exposition&quot;&gt;countersubjects&lt;/a&gt;, but only countersubject 2 is reused in the development section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/legacy/bach-oops-cs1.png&quot; alt=&quot;IBW Oops I Did It Again Countersubject 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countersubject 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/legacy/bach-oops-cs2.png&quot; alt=&quot;bach-oops-IBW Oops I Did It Again Countersubject 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countersubject 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tonal outline of the piece is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (mm1) C# minor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (~mm18) E major&lt;/li&gt;

&quot;Just a small town girl  

Living in a lonely world  

She took the midnight train  

Going anywhere&quot;  

          -Journey  

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admit it, you were singing along! Not to dismiss the importance of good lyrics, I&amp;#39;ve always been more attached to melodies, harmonies and bass lines than lead vocals; I learned all the notes in this song long before I knew all the words. Whether you love Journey&amp;#39;s lyrics, instrumentals, or hate Journey entirely, I hope that you enjoy this version of &amp;quot;If Bach Wrote.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;welcome-back&quot;&gt;Welcome back...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the second installment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/tag/ifbachwrote/&quot;&gt;If Bach Wrote...&lt;/a&gt; (IBW). If Bach Wrote... (IBW) is a personal project of mine where I regularly pick an iconic tune from pop culture, extract melodic material from it, and compose a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue&quot;&gt;fugue&lt;/a&gt; with that melody as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.northern.edu/wieland/theory/form/fugue.htm&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A handful of weeks ago I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony&quot;&gt;polyphonic&lt;/a&gt; treatment of Lil Jon and DJ Snake&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/music/if-bach-wrote-turn-down-for-what&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Turn Down for What&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and was pleasantly surprised by the number of hits it got. People more or less had nice things to say about it, too. So, if you listened: thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Original&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you may want to &lt;a href=&quot;#score&quot;&gt;view the score&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m convinced that all American citizens have this song tattooed on their brains, but just in case you want to hear it ooooone moooore tiiiiime, here&amp;#39;s a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/1k8craCGpgs&quot;&gt;original recording&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to take the left-hand half of the piano part from the intro as this fugue&amp;#39;s subject and answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In notation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/legacy/Screen-Shot-2014-08-01-at-5.15.57-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;IBW Don&amp;#39;t Stop Believin Subject&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subject, in E major: I V vi IV&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/legacy/Screen-Shot-2014-08-01-at-5.16.18-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;IBW Don&amp;#39;t Stop Believin Answer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonal Answer, in E major: V ii-V42 IV V6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fugue makes use of two countersubjects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/legacy/Screen-Shot-2014-08-01-at-5.25.36-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Countersubject 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countersubject 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/legacy/Screen-Shot-2014-08-01-at-5.25.55-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Countersubject 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countersubject 2, free counterpoint thereafter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may notice that Countersubject sounds a tiny bit like the right-hand piano part of the song - this was unintentional but welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exposition is strict with very little free counterpoint, so it&amp;#39;s over fairly quickly for a four-voice fugue. The development begins in measure 17. The subject is stated many times throughout the piece per se, in simplified rhythms, &lt;a href=&quot;http://composerstoolbox.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/tool-17-augmentation-and-diminution/&quot;&gt;augmented&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music)&quot;&gt;inverted&lt;/a&gt;. I am particularly proud of measures 49-59, where the subject is iterated concurrently per se and in augmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tonal outline of the piece is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (mm1) E major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (mm~25) C# minor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (mm35) A major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (mm41) F# minor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (mm45) A major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (mm49) D major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (mm53) C# minor (Not quite what Bach would do, but I couldn&amp;#39;t resist)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  (mm60) E major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
