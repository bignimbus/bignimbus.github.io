        <title>Software ate the world; what's AI going to do to software?</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/fish-eat-fish.png&quot; alt=&quot;Software ate the world; what's AI going to do to software?&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the AI era can be understood as the migration of users from producer-published software to platform-published software.  The specifics of how that happens have massive implications for our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These predictions are built on the stipulation that users will increasingly make AI platforms an indispensable part of their daily lives.  It’s completely valid to reject that premise, I just want to be forthcoming about what assumptions I’ve baked into this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-publication-via-platforms&quot;&gt;Software publication via platforms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the internet, consumers use software to transact with producers.  That software is typically developed and published by the producers.  And that software is designed to serve the interests of the producer.  TikTok wants you to watch more videos (see more ads).  Indeed wants you to apply for more jobs.  DoorDash wants to bundle shaving cream from CVS along with the burrito that Chipotle’s making you.  They’ll develop their software accordingly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      alt=&quot;A flow diagram showing three rectangular boxes connected in sequence. On the left is a green box labeled “Consumer,” in the middle a blue box labeled “Software,” and on the right a blue box labeled “Producer.” The Consumer connects to the Software with a dotted arrow pointing both ways, while the Software and Producer are connected with a solid two-way arrow.&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/software-ate-the-world/consumer-producer.png&quot;
    /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But software is rarely distributed by the producer.  It’s downloaded by the user through a platform.  Today’s dominant software platforms are the web and app stores.  The producer distributes their software by making it available - publishing it - to a place where consumers can find it.  The web’s constraints on users and publishers are largely technical and generally not economic - there’s no &lt;em&gt;de jure&lt;/em&gt; rent-seeking entity there.  App stores, though, are a different beast.  We’ll get into that in a moment.  But let’s update our diagram:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      alt=&quot;A flow diagram with four labeled elements. On the left, a green box labeled “Consumer” connects with a dotted two-way arrow to a blue box labeled “Software.” The software box sits inside a larger orange box labeled “Platform.” To the right, the software connects with a solid two-way arrow to another blue box labeled “Producer.&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/software-ate-the-world/consumer-producer-platform.png&quot;
    /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-iPhone, when Steve Jobs and Tim Apple saw that diagram their pupils turned into dollar signs.  They correctly predicted that the platform could be a source of incredible leverage given a critical mass of users, which they brought to bear with spectacular results.  Unfortunately for the Apple folks, there’s a limit to that power.  Apple publishes only a relative handful of apps themselves, which puts them partially at the mercy of publishers/producers.  If they alienate the producers, the value of the platform goes down.  Let’s draw a rectangle in our diagram to illustrate.  Look at all those blue boxes that can gang up on Big Orange:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      alt=&quot;A flow diagram showing a green box labeled “Consumer” on the left, connected with dotted arrows to three blue boxes labeled “App A,” “App B,” and “App C,” which are all inside a larger orange box labeled “Platform.” Each app has a label “published by” pointing to a corresponding blue box on the right: “Producer A,” “Producer B,” and “Producer C.” The structure shows consumers accessing apps through a platform, with each app linked to a different producer.&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/software-ate-the-world/platform-published.png&quot;
    /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-enshittification-quotient&quot;&gt;The enshittification quotient&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call that the &lt;em&gt;enshittification quotient&lt;/em&gt;: the maximum extent to which a platform can capture value from transactions between consumers and producers therein.  The web has an enshittification quotient that approaches zero, though user tracking/ad tech are a really interesting side quest that I won’t go into because they’re not inherently a part of the platform.  App stores have a much higher enshittification quotient.  There are a ton of other examples out there, but I want to remain laser-focused on software distribution because I think that’s where persons of conscience should focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new type of platform emerging, though, and that’s the AI Agent.  I’m sure you’ve heard of it.  If you’re in Control-F mode, I’ll also call this ChatGPT, Chatbots, AI assistants, LLMs, agentic experiences, and so on.  I’ll be grateful for one authoritative collective noun to describe this type of thing.  These platforms have a unique capability: they can generate and execute code.  That makes all the difference in the world because it means the platform has no theoretical limit on how much software it can publish.  The enshittification quotient for an AI Agent platform is unknown; it has no theoretical ceiling but could be bounded by certain market conditions.  We’re early enough in the process that there’s considerable opportunity to limit the damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a fictionalized AI Agent that exists in the very near future, let’s buy a rug. Prompt:  “I want a 5x8 rug in a geometric pattern, mostly earth tones.”  What do we see?  The AI Agent platform can’t design, fabricate, and ship a rug right there (though that’s an interesting rabbit hole to go down) - they’ll need to connect the consumer’s prompt to a plausible match from a producer.  It’ll probably respond with a few rectangular cards containing some rug choices.  For simplicity’s sake, let’s say I like the second one, which shows a little icon that indicates that it’s from Target, and a price of $99.99.  Prompt: “The second one.”  Response: “Great. I’ll place that order now.”  I get notified when the transaction completes and later when it ships.  Cool.  Where will AI Agent Platform, Inc. get the right to show Target’s inventory and branding in their experience?  That’s the key question.  It turns out, there’s another layer (APIs) in our diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      alt=&quot;A flow diagram showing relationships between consumers, an AI platform, APIs, and producers. On the left, a green box labeled “Consumer” connects with a dotted two-way arrow to a beige box labeled “Generated Software,” which sits inside a larger orange box labeled “AI Platform.” From the AI Platform, dotted arrows connect to three blue boxes labeled “API A,” “API B,” and “API C,” grouped under the heading “Who controls these?” Each API box connects with a dotted arrow to a corresponding blue box on the right: “Producer A,” “Producer B,” and “Producer C.”&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/software-ate-the-world/api-layer.png&quot;
    /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the producers’ data and capabilities are largely coupled with the software applications they publish.  Their house, their rules.  But when software distribution becomes a property of AI platforms, it’s possible (though not a foregone conclusion) that data/transactions could follow suit, at least to some extent.  One thing is clear to me, though: AI Platforms will not make money from providing LLMs as a service in the foreseeable future unless the underlying tech gets orders of magnitude more efficient.  But if the hosted LLM side of the business is a loss leader in the pursuit of a dominant platform that encompasses both the software and the underlying data transactions, that’s a much more compelling business idea.  The rent-seeking potential of such a platform scares me on behalf of consumers and producers.  The entire supply chain could be verticalized; imagine Amazon’s dominance in cloud, retail, and logistics but also with a ubiquitous software creation and distribution platform stapled on.  Enshittification quotient = infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;predictions-in-the-platform-published-software-era&quot;&gt;Predictions in the platform-published software era&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the caveat that antitrust law (will that exist in ten years?) could prevent some of the worst excesses of such a scenario, what conclusions can we draw from this hypothetical example?  Here’s my take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-in-the-gold-rush-analogy-ai-isn-t-the-gold-it-s-the-shovel&quot;&gt;1. In the “gold rush” analogy, AI isn’t the gold, it’s the shovel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is the gold.  The hype cycle around AI makes it tempting to treat the models themselves as the prize. They’re not. Models are infrastructure: the picks and shovels of this era. They are necessary to participate, but they’re not where the lasting value accrues. What matters is not who has the fanciest shovel, but who owns the gold mine. In the AI context, the “mine” is the data and transaction layer: the flows of inventory, prices, user intents, and completed exchanges that feed the real economy. Whoever controls that registry will have enduring leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-ai-wrappers-aka-agentic-development-won-t-last-long&quot;&gt;2. AI wrappers (aka agentic development) won’t last long&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies are now building “agentic experiences”: thin wrappers around foundation models, dressed up with a prompt template and a UI. These are useful as an extension of the producer-published software model, but I don’t believe they have a durable future because they’re structurally misaligned with both consumer behavior and platform economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers won’t want to jump from app to app to ask slightly different AI agents to do the same things given a compelling alternative (again, I’m assuming that consumers will increasingly adopt AI platforms). Nobody will open their travel app to type “reserve three nights at the Doubletree in Toronto” into a worse version of ChatGPT, then switch over to the retail app to tell a nerfed Claude they need a new nightstand. That future looks absurd. Consumers put their food orders into DoorDash rather than juggling a dozen restaurant sites, and they will consolidate their various transactions into a handful of dominant AI platforms that can mediate across domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the producer side, the incentives to invest in standalone applications will wane. Maintaining a full-stack app, whether it’s a traditional UI or an agentic experience, is expensive and offers diminishing returns if consumers are defaulting to agents. Web and mobile app development won’t disappear; they’re here to stay.  But if the dominant channel for discovery and transaction is an AI platform, producers will pour their energy into making sure their inventory, pricing, and services are optimized for that platform’s data and transaction conventions. Application development becomes less about bespoke consumer software and more about maintaining a compliant, performant data interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same logic applies to chatbots. For the last decade, companies have been coaxed into building their own “assistant experiences” inside apps and websites. These efforts rarely delighted customers, and in an agent-dominated world they will make even less sense. Why build and maintain a second-rate chatbot if consumers can get a first-rate one that already knows their order history, payment methods, and preferences? One-off chatbots will survive only in tightly scoped niches, not as a general strategy for consumer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: the application layer itself is shrinking. Producers won’t stop investing in digital presence altogether, but the locus of value shifts from publishing and owning a bespoke app to participating in and hedging against the platform’s publishing layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-producers-stand-to-lose-a-lot-of-value&quot;&gt;3. Producers stand to lose a lot of value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When producers no longer publish their own software, they risk being reduced to interchangeable data sources inside someone else’s platform. That shift strips away the direct brand presence (the Starbucks app, the Delta notifications, the Netflix interface) and replaces it with a widget in an agent’s results. Producers become dependent on the ranking algorithms and monetization policies of the platform, just as Amazon sellers live or die by search placement. Margins compress, competition is reframed around who can satisfy the platform’s incentives, and the producer’s relationship with its customer becomes mediated, if not severed. This is the most immediate danger of the platform-as-publisher economy: the alienation of producers from their services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-everyday-people-will-suffer-if-ai-platforms-become-buyer-and-seller-agents&quot;&gt;4. Everyday people will suffer if AI platforms become buyer and seller agents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For consumers, the story is no brighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States v. Google LLC&lt;/em&gt; was adjudicated against Google for monopolizing the search engine and search advertising markets, most notably on Android devices, as well as with Apple and mobile carriers.  The gist of this case is that Google’s ad marketplace represented the platform, buyers, and sellers.  They used the inherent leverage of that position and its (bought and paid for) dominance in the web and mobile markets to cement its dominance.  The harm to users was and continues to be evident.  Had any of those parties (platform, buyer, seller) been represented by an adversarial organization, the competitive pressure would have made a huge difference in mitigating the moral hazard and distributing more value to the stakeholders in the resulting system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson?  When platforms act as publishers, they gain the power to arbitrate not just discovery, but also the terms of engagement: which products are surfaced, how prices are presented, what add-ons are bundled. More of the economic surplus shifts toward arbitrage and rent-seeking instead of value creation. Consumers face higher prices, less transparency, and less choice. The governance of these platforms will likely be opaque, algorithmic, and unaccountable.  So if the trajectory of past platforms is any guide, enshittification is a feature not a bug, and everyday people are the ones who pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-role-as-tech-people&quot;&gt;Our role as tech people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize: the AI era can be broadly understood as the unbounded expansion of software publication by dominant platforms. That collapse could drive user hostility to an intolerable extent if it also encompasses the data transactions that have been traditionally coupled with producer-published applications. Unless producers retain leverage over that all-important data layer, they will be reduced to line items in someone else’s prompt response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: enshittification is not a general term that refers to software getting progressively worse.  It’s a specific tendency of big platforms described by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456&quot;&gt;Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;: (1) gain a critical mass of consumers by offering value at a loss; (2) attract a critical mass of producers by brokering consumer data and engagement, still at a loss; (3) incrementally and progressively exploit both tenants once the cost of switching becomes sufficiently high.  We are currently in phase 1: AI products are being jammed down our throats left and right, often at low or no cost to the consumer.  The unit economics are awful for the platform until they reach phase 3, and I am convinced that phase 2 (and therefore, 3) &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be prevented, though I don’t know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can offer is a challenge to the tech industry: our opportunity and the urgent calling of this era is to build the technical and economic infrastructure to ensure that AI platforms cannot double- or triple-deal between consumers, producers, and themselves.  The consequence of failure are dire.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to move from LastPass to Bitwarden in ten minutes</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/lastpass-to-bitwarden.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to move from LastPass to Bitwarden in ten minutes&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;LastPass recently notified users that their free product will drastically
change on 2021-03-16 in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lastpass.com/2021/02/changes-to-lastpass-free/&quot;&gt;a recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;.
I believe
this change is being made irresponsibly,
but you can read my opinion in a follow-up post I&amp;#39;m planning.
Many non-paying users are looking around
for alternatives.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitwarden.com/&quot;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt; fits the bill nicely
for me: it has desktop, mobile, and web apps with the same features as LastPass,
plus it has the benefit of being largely
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitwarden&quot;&gt;open-source software&lt;/a&gt;
distributed under GPL/AGPL licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitwarden&amp;#39;s help docs have a decent
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitwarden.com/help/article/import-from-lastpass/&quot;&gt;guide to help users import data from LastPass&lt;/a&gt;
but if you need some additional resources, please read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;export-your-lastpass-data&quot;&gt;Export your LastPass data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, be aware that you will be downloading a file containing
all the username/password combinations you have stored in LastPass.  This
file will not be encrypted - the passwords will be in plain text.
Once you&amp;#39;re done copying your data into Bitwarden, delete all the data you
downloaded from LastPass so that it is no longer available on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a desktop or laptop, log into LastPass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the navigation panel on the left side of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Options&lt;/strong&gt;.  A new menu will appear to the right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap &lt;strong&gt;Export&lt;/strong&gt;.  You will be prompted to enter your master password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The screen may appear unresponsive for a short time.  That is normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 400px&quot;
        alt=&quot;LastPass interface showing the left navigation bar open and 'Advanced Options' highlighted&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/lastpass-to-bitwarden/desktop-1.png&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 400px&quot;
        alt=&quot;LastPass interface showing the left navigation bar open and 'Export' highlighted&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/lastpass-to-bitwarden/desktop-2.png&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;
      Use the left navigation to drill down: &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Options&lt;/strong&gt; 👉 &lt;strong&gt;Export&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser window will turn white and black text will appear.  This text contains all the usernames, passwords, etc. you store in LastPass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave this window open for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a plain text editor.  If you're not sure what a plain text editor is,
don't worry.  You have one installed on your operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight and copy all the text from the open LastPass window.  Paste
it into your text editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the file as &lt;code&gt;export.csv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid inadvertently pasting this sensitive information somewhere
else, copy some other text as a safeguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sign-up-for-bitwarden&quot;&gt;Sign up for Bitwarden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitwarden.com&quot;&gt;bitwarden.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Tap &amp;quot;Get Started&amp;quot; in the top
right corner.  You will be prompted to enter your email address and to set
a master password, much like LastPass.  I recommend using a password that
is different from your LastPass master password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have completed registration and confirmed your email address,
log into Bitwarden again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap &lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt; at the top of the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the left, tap &lt;strong&gt;Import Data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;1. Select the format of the import file&lt;/strong&gt;, select
&amp;quot;LastPass (csv).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;2. Select the import file&lt;/strong&gt;, select the &lt;code&gt;export.csv&lt;/code&gt; file you created earlier.  Tap the button labeled &lt;strong&gt;Import Data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 400px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Text editor showing a file called 'export.csv' with data&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/lastpass-to-bitwarden/desktop-3.png&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 400px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Bitwarden interface showing the 'Tools' section open and 'Import Data' highlighted&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/lastpass-to-bitwarden/desktop-4.png&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;
      Copy the LastPass export into &lt;code&gt;exports.csv&lt;/code&gt; using a plain text editor like Notepad, TextEdit, or Vim.  Tap &lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt; 👉  &lt;strong&gt;Import Data&lt;/strong&gt; and upload &lt;code&gt;exports.csv&lt;/code&gt;.
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your data should now be available.  According to Bitwarden&amp;#39;s documentation,
some users have experienced issues with the encoding of certain special
characters in passwords:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some users have reported a bug which changes special characters in your passwords (&amp;amp;, &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, etc.) to their HTML-encoded values (for example, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; in the printed export.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you observe this bug in your exported data, use a text editor to find and replace all altered values before importing into Bitwarden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t come across anything like that yet, but I transitioned very recently.
I will update this post if I come across anything unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ios-users-update-autofill&quot;&gt;iOS users: update AutoFill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not an iOS user, &lt;a href=&quot;#delete-your-lastpass&quot;&gt;skip this section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an iOS user, I am accustomed to using LastPass to autofill passwords.
After installing the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitwarden-password-manager/id1137397744&quot;&gt;Bitwarden app&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go into &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a good idea to hold onto your LastPass free account for a short time,
at least until you are reasonably certain Bitwarden is meeting your needs and
that all of your data was copied over successfully.  I haven&amp;#39;t done this part
yet, but
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lastpass.com/delete_account.php&quot;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;
makes it seem pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Snow removal tasks as a kanban board</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/snow-removal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Snow removal tasks as a kanban board&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with many places in North America this winter, we&amp;#39;ve seen more snowstorms
than usual recently.  For those of us who are responsible for clearing a
property of snow, that means work.  I tend to want to make work as orderly
as plausible, and I&amp;#39;ve been removing snow for long enough to have a sense of
what needs to be done.  So I naturally created a kanban board for these tasks.
I chose Airtable because that platform facilitates easy copying and extending.
I&amp;#39;ve pasted the full description underneath the embedded board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;airtable-embed&quot; src=&quot;https://airtable.com/embed/shrchyBc2AZML7PoY?backgroundColor=blue&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; onmousewheel=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; style=&quot;background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy-able public kanban board that captures snow removal tasks for what I reckon is a typical single-family dwelling with a driveway and/or sidewalk in North America. Fields for blockers, priority, and estimated effort are included. All tasks include acceptance criteria and some contain additional descriptions that may include links to external resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tasks make use of Imperial units. The links regarding legal requirements and postal service guidelines are geared toward USA residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have populated the tasks with estimates and prioritization that reflect my own needs, please don’t feel obligated to apply my own estimates and prioritization to your own unique residence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel that a certain addition or edit would be generally useful, please add a comment or send me a message and I’d be happy to consider an update to this board. In particular, it would be nice to internationalize this board in earnest. Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Git to run ESLint on changed files in a feature branch</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/git-lint.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using Git to run ESLint on changed files in a feature branch&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lied a bit in the title: this works for any static analysis tool.
So if you&amp;#39;re a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rubocop.org/&quot;&gt;RuboCop&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pylint.org/&quot;&gt;Pylint&lt;/a&gt;,
or [insert awesome static analysis util here] user, this solution
has you covered.  The impetus for this post was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot;&gt;ESLint&lt;/a&gt;,
though, so I&amp;#39;ll use that for the sake of a specific example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself in the unenviable position of trying to introduce
a new linter rule.  The reason this was such a pain was because
there were over 4,000 violations in our codebase, and this particular
rule didn&amp;#39;t have an automated fix available.  The manual fix wasn&amp;#39;t
just a matter of style, either &amp;mdash; it would require regression-testing
every module it touched.  That&amp;#39;s out of the question.  Ignoring the
error was impossible, too, because our CI build runs &lt;code&gt;eslint&lt;/code&gt; against
all of our frontend code.  And making it a warning would not sufficiently
incentivize the team to fix the underlying issues this rule is supposed
to police.  What to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transitional-config&quot;&gt;Transitional config&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I set up a &amp;quot;transitional&amp;quot; config file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# .eslintrc.transitional&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;./.eslintrc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;my-new-rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this extends our existing configuration, adding just one
modification.  To ensure that any text editor integrations register
the rule so that it&amp;#39;s visible, I also modified the main config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# .eslintrc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;my-new-rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;warn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the groundwork is there.  Next, I set up a new script in
&lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;lint:transitional&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;eslint -c ./.eslintrc.transitional --no-error-on-unmatched-pattern&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-git-diff&quot;&gt;Using git diff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the secret sauce: in the same CI build step as where we run
&lt;code&gt;eslint&lt;/code&gt; against our entire frontend codebase, I added a step
where we run &lt;code&gt;lint:transitional&lt;/code&gt; only on files that have been
changed in that particular branch.  &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; to the rescue!  One hiccup
we ran into is that deleted file paths were being checked, which caused
&lt;code&gt;eslint&lt;/code&gt; to return an error code.  Adding &lt;code&gt;--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern&lt;/code&gt;
resolved this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# get a list of js/ts files that are different from master&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# at the merge-base&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DIFFED_FILES_TO_LINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git diff master... &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name-only&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;*.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;*.tsx&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;*.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;*.jsx&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# execute eslint with the &quot;transitional&quot; rules&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# only on touched files.&lt;/span&gt;
yarn lint:transitional &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$DIFFED_FILES_TO_LINT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more info on that &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; command, check out this
&lt;a href=&quot;https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=git+diff+master...my-branch+--name-only+--+%22*.ts%22+%22*.tsx%22+%22*.js%22+%22*.jsx%22&quot;&gt;explainshell&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20808892/git-diff-between-current-branch-and-master-but-not-including-unmerged-master-com/20809283#20809283&quot;&gt;This StackOverflow answer&lt;/a&gt;
is also illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-that-accomplish&quot;&gt;What did that accomplish?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now introduce a painful but ultimately helpful new rule 
gradually.  When a team touches a file with which they are
familiar, paying down the technical debt pointed out by the new
rule becomes a matter of necessity.  Since (presumably) developers
are only touching files that are relevant to the work they are
shipping, the chance of a regression is lower than it would be if
some intrepid but less-familiar engineer took it upon themselves
to try to update the whole code base at once.  The total number
of violations will gradually decrement, and so too will the
as-of-now unknown pain points that may be associated with fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pop-Punk: a vim color scheme</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/pop-punk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pop-Punk: a vim color scheme&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using the vim text editor for a while now.  I
know some basic
&lt;a href=&quot;https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/&quot;&gt;vimscript&lt;/a&gt;,
but not much more.  A while ago, I settled on a version of
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gkjgh/cobalt&quot;&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt; color scheme
as my theme of choice.  I made a few tweaks here and there
over the course of a few years.  It started to become more
noticeably painful to change colors after a while - sometimes
I&amp;#39;d update a hex color and forget to update the corresponding
cterm value.  And as I got deeper into customizing my terminal,
I got deeper into tweaking my vim setup.  So I decided it was
high time to solidify all the tweaks I made into a coherent
color scheme (with a matching airline theme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bignimbus/pop-punk.vim&quot;&gt;pop-punk.vim&lt;/a&gt;:
a dark, high-contrast color scheme that retains a sense of
fun and character.  If you&amp;#39;re a vim user, I&amp;#39;d love to hear
what you think of it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Principles for an Effective Distributed Team</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/home-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Principles for an Effective Distributed Team&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2020 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/70-percent-of-people-globally-work-remotely-at-least-once-a-week-iwg-study.html&quot;&gt;people work from home&lt;/a&gt;.  The benefits are intuitive: commutes are often risky and can be a waste of time and natural resources; plus removing geographical barriers can increase the size of the recruitment pipeline.
Even though some companies are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/07/11/535398716/some-employers-are-rethinking-telework-citing-a-need-for-better-collaboration&quot;&gt;making headlines by bucking that trend&lt;/a&gt;,
remote working is a fact of life.  People get sick; they make appointments during business hours; they want to keep their heads
down and focus away from their sometimes-distracting office; they want to catch up before or after hours on something important
to their work.  Face it: your teams needs to be able to function outside of a centralized workplace.  Whether your team is entirely
distributed, completely on-site, or some hybrid thereof, try to mind these principles to empower your team for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;principles-for-teams&quot;&gt;Principles for Teams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web has made physical distance less meaningful than ever before in human history.  This means that teams have the power to
work in ways that were impossible a generation ago.  With this great power
comes great responsibility, and that responsibility must not fall exclusively on those who happen to be working outside of the space
where most of the team works.  Before reading, take stock of what kind of team you&amp;#39;re working with: are there any teammates,
vendors or consultants working off-site?  How many?  How often do teammates work from home?  With these facts in mind, consider the
principles below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manage-availability-and-expectations&quot;&gt;Manage Availability and Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teammates need to know what to expect of one another.  It&amp;#39;s easy to tell when someone is away from their desk in person,
but folks working off-site have no easy way to peek over at someone&amp;#39;s desk and figure out their immediate availability,
and vice versa.  Ensure teammates are aware of each other&amp;#39;s work hours by keeping shared calendars updated.  Don&amp;#39;t be distant on
instant messenger either: status messages or quick FYIs are a great way to keep everyone&amp;mdash;regardless of location&amp;mdash;aware
of when someone&amp;#39;s working and when they&amp;#39;re not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your team evaluates teammates in a way that could &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; penalize someone who is off-site, consider reworking those criteria.
A results-oriented evaluation system will support work habits that empower all teammates to succeed regardless of their
latitude and longitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Silo&amp;quot; is a dirty word in the workplace.  Teams should avoid balkanizing their communications wherever possible.  Informal chats
about &lt;em&gt;Product A&lt;/em&gt; in the break room can quickly turn into actionable work.  An instant message chain in a small channel can snowball
into a full-blown spec in no time.  The simple solution?  Take notes!  Sharing a photo of the back of a napkin or a quick email
summary can help keep the team abreast of developments that will impact their work.  This sort of artifact generation also comes in
handy months or even years later when trying to retrace the evolution of a product or feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;invest-in-telepresence&quot;&gt;Invest in Telepresence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio/video quality directly impacts communication quality.  Invest in the right hardware and software in
order to minimize potential disruptions and maximize comprehension.  Set aside a few minutes before a video conference to make
sure that the camera and microphone are set up and working.  Teammates shouldn&amp;#39;t wait for others in a teleconference to
tell them that they can&amp;#39;t be heard or seen&amp;mdash;beginning a meeting with &amp;quot;can you see and hear me?&amp;quot; makes a world of difference.
Ideally, the answer is &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; but if not, everyone needs to pitch in (within reason) in order to troubleshoot and resolve the problem.
This can be burdensome, but it&amp;#39;s far less disruptive than an information deficit that leads to a defect in the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As important as A/V quality is, telepresence is not the same as physical prescence.  In fact, telepresence is a skill that can be
cultivated and improved with enough care and attention.
Keeping the camera and
microphone on is a good practice, but don&amp;#39;t be alarmed or judgmental of teammates who switch off sometimes.  There&amp;#39;s a difference
between being physically together in the same space and having your head on a large-screen television for all to see up-close.
To avoid falling into the trap of &amp;quot;multitasking&amp;quot; and other attention-draining activities during video conferences, try not touching
the computer at all.  Note-taking or even idle doodling could be an effective way of practicing mindful telepresence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bond&quot;&gt;Bond&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spontaneity and shared experiences are the foundation for meaningful human connections.  There&amp;#39;s no reason why these ideals
can&amp;#39;t be met digitally!  Team instant message channels could ensure there&amp;#39;s a space for unplanned, not-necessarily-work-related
fun.  Keeping an open-invitation video conference is a nice way for collegues to digitally &amp;quot;visit&amp;quot; each other&amp;#39;s work places.  Team
outings are a great way to bond, but try to balance out those activities with location-independent events.  Internet games, book clubs,
and fantasy sports are just a few ways to be geographically inclusive.  Scheduling one-on-one conversations with teammates you&amp;#39;ll never
physically &amp;quot;bump into&amp;quot; in a shared office is a great way to nurture connections (even if your teammate isn&amp;#39;t your &amp;quot;work friend&amp;quot;).
Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to use video chat just to say hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-inclusive&quot;&gt;Be Inclusive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When teammates work across more than one work space, it&amp;#39;s imperative that everyone pitch in to make it work.  Investments in
a distributed workforce will benefit the whole team, even if most or all workers are on-site most of the time.  Build a lexicon
of non-judgmental terms to foster inclusivity.  Instead of being &amp;quot;at home,&amp;quot; teammates are &amp;quot;in the cloud.&amp;quot;  Instead of
&amp;quot;spending&amp;quot; time getting the new conference room microphone set up, &amp;quot;invest&amp;quot; that time.  Teammates don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;get to&amp;quot; work from
home&amp;mdash;it&amp;#39;s not a personal favor&amp;mdash;they&amp;#39;re just working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working outside of a central office is easier when teammates understand what to expect.  If teammates are encouraged to occasionally
work from home, it&amp;#39;s likely that they will understand the needs of off-site teammates more.  Another strategy would be to
hold an &amp;quot;all-remote&amp;quot; meeting where all attendees&amp;mdash;even if most of them are in the same
office&amp;mdash;join a teleconference individually.  This will help build empathy amongst teammates by putting everyone on equal
footing with regards to telepresence.  The quality of the A/V might be surprising too: one microphone and one camera per person
can do wonders for communication clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the team is spread across more than one time zone, there are two rules that must be followed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always mind the time zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously, always mind the time zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mealtimes will vary.  Mind that, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tips-for-remote-workers&quot;&gt;Tips for Remote Workers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are suggestions for someone working off-site, even if it&amp;#39;s only for a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practice-self-care&quot;&gt;Practice Self-Care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dont-guilt-yourself&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#39;t guilt yourself&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working remotely has pros and cons for yourself and the team.  There&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; way to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;take-breaks&quot;&gt;Take breaks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat a meal, drink a beverage, exercise, take a walk, do something to take care of your mind and body.
When the end of the day comes, make sure you&amp;#39;ve done at least one thing other than sitting at your workstation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;embrace-being-a-head-in-a-box&quot;&gt;Embrace being a head in a box&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer you&amp;#39;re out of a central workplace, the more you become associated with whatever electronic communciation media
your team uses.  You&amp;#39;re basically a head in a box; don&amp;#39;t fight it!  Have fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintain-professional-relationships&quot;&gt;Maintain professional relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re working from home, it&amp;#39;s easy to neglect your professional network/community.  If you can&amp;#39;t go to meetups or other events
physically, there are ways to stay &amp;quot;in the loop&amp;quot; with people and ideas in your industry.  Seek and cultivate those opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structure-your-time-and-space&quot;&gt;Structure Your Time and Space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;commute-to-work&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Commute&amp;quot; to work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boundaries between personal and work time can help you protect the former and focus on the latter.  Maintain two daily rituals before
and after work hours to structure your day: a workout, a walk, an errand, a coffee run, taking the kids to/from school, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;have-a-designated-work-space&quot;&gt;Have a designated work &amp;quot;space&amp;quot;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of an office needs to be adapted in order to apply to remote work.  Whether you set up shop in your
single-family home five days a week or travel the world in a van, guerilla-working from wherever you can find the
best coffee and wifi, crafting an office can be a great way to tacitly enforce boundaries
between work and life.  In 2020, your office is not necessarily a physical area; it can be a state of mind.
If you work from your home, avoid regularly working in areas reserved for eating, sleeping, or leisure.  Those
spots can be great for taking a one-on-one or for an occasional change of scenery, but they are too tightly coupled
with your personal life for routine productivity.  Strive to find a location other than your dining table to get
things done on a regular basis.  If your locale changes regularly, try to find something to help trick your brain
into perceiving an &amp;quot;office.&amp;quot;  For some, simply starting at a fixed time of day is a good way to mentally tag
their &amp;quot;office.&amp;quot;  For others, wearing a certain pin or other accessory during business hours may do the trick.
Whatever your solution, make your &amp;quot;office&amp;quot; something that consistently differentiates work time from the other
parts of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-be-a-stranger&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Be a Stranger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;make-time-for-relationships&quot;&gt;Make time for relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go out of your way&amp;mdash;schedule it if you must&amp;mdash;to connect and reconnect with colleagues.  Keep in mind, though, that
staying connected is a shared responsibility.  Don&amp;#39;t shoulder everything yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;see-and-be-seen&quot;&gt;See and be seen&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t turn off your camera during video conferences unless you need to, and do your best to participate in situations that
haven&amp;#39;t been optimized for videoconferencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maintain-professionalism&quot;&gt;Maintain Professionalism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-dressed&quot;&gt;Get dressed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even pants.  You might think you&amp;#39;re only visible from the shoulders up, but just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;master-your-communication-apps&quot;&gt;Master your communication apps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get to know your instant message, video conference, and VOIP apps better than anyone.  Learn how to troubleshoot efficiently.
Become a power user to minimize technical difficulties and maximize utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;be-available&quot;&gt;Be available&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all messages can be returned right away&amp;mdash;teammates won&amp;#39;t always mind your status/away message or check your calendar
before sending an IM your way.  Find ways to respond, even if it&amp;#39;s a triage message, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, I&amp;#39;m in meetings all afternoon so I can get focus on this starting around 4:00pm Eastern Time.  In the meantime, I think
Charlie might be able to help out.  I&amp;#39;m setting a reminder for myself now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;children-and-animals&quot;&gt;Children and animals...&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... can be welcome &amp;quot;guest stars&amp;quot; on camera.  They can also be a distraction.  Always be mindful of the context and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Methodical UI: removing frustration from HTML and CSS development</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/car-mirror.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Methodical UI: removing frustration from HTML and CSS development&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;re a developer.  Maybe you&amp;#39;re a designer.  Maybe
you&amp;#39;re a software project manager.  Chances are that you&amp;#39;re dealing with
at least a bit of HTML and/or CSS during a typical work week.  What&amp;#39;s
your workflow for that? If you&amp;#39;re like most honest people, your answer
is: &amp;quot;it depends.&amp;quot;  In the past, my workflow looked a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do another thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thing 1 is messed up so I need to do it again but differently now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust spacing on thing 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way I was gonna do the next thing is now not going to work for some reason
...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;42. Done! Just don&amp;#39;t ask how&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this sounds familiar? If it&amp;#39;s working for you, that&amp;#39;s great! The
rest of this article is probably not for you. But if you&amp;#39;re tired of tying your
virtual shoelaces together, there are two ways to make this process less painful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get better at HTML and CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure your workflow to minimize having to go back and fix things that were working fine before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 1 will work very well. Fluency with HTML and CSS will grant you much more
command over the web browser and reduce the amount of times you run into
dead ends in the development process. Improving your skills will also facilitate quick
recovery from setbacks. But absent
a reliable workflow, setbacks are still inevitable. In the swirling vortex of uncertainty
that is user interface development, a structured approach is the key to sustainable,
predictable, and manageable progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-html-and-css-can-be-so-frustrating&quot;&gt;Why HTML and CSS can be so frustrating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get one thing out of the way: coding can be frustrating no matter what you&amp;#39;re
trying to build.  HTML and CSS, though, are frustrating in ways that are distinct
from other software-creation tasks.  And that frustration isn&amp;#39;t unique to a single
type of worker.  If you&amp;#39;re used to creating interfaces in a
GUI or WYSIWYG such as those provided by Adobe, InVision, and others, using a text
editor in order to express your ideas may feel cumbersome and opaque.
If you&amp;#39;re
a software developer, you may be more comfortable creating things that operate
in a world of black-and-white: either the program works according to spec or it
doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, coding in HTML and CSS produces a
formatted, styled document; coding in a programming language produces a program.
Because these media are so different, it&amp;#39;s only natural that folks who have put
a lot of time into the latter might find the former to feel like a chore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say programming isn&amp;#39;t difficult. Seasoned professionals can
struggle for months trying to turn
input X into output Y.  At the end of the day, though, programmers can
rely on tools such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end
tests in order to remove uncertainty from the creative process.  If your
test suite is well-written and all the tests pass, then the team can be
fairly confident that the program meets its requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML and CSS offer no such comfort. Robust test suites for
validating colors, fonts,
positioning, and other peculiar aspects of user interfaces simply don&amp;#39;t exist. Just as
da Vinci couldn&amp;#39;t ask a machine whether &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/em&gt; was ready for the public - though I&amp;#39;m
sure he probably sketched such a machine at some point - UI developers must also determine
the correctness of their work by manually inspecting it. Instead of a single canvas, however,
we must check our work on a variety of media, any or all of: phones, tablets, laptops,
desktops, screen readers, smart TVs and game consoles. The lack of computable acceptance
criteria and the diversity of media that can view a hypertext document makes
HTML and CSS a frustratingly imprecise art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reason to despair, though. Despite HTML and CSS&amp;#39;s limitations, we can borrow
ideas from programming best practices in order to add structure to the UI development
process. Whether you&amp;#39;re a dyed-in-the-wool front-end developer,
a hobbyist, a designer who dabbles, or a project manager that needs to ship an A/B test every
now and then, a methodical approach can keep you reasonably certain that the code you&amp;#39;re
writing now is not messing up the code you&amp;#39;ve already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-need-to-know&quot;&gt;What you need to know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A methodical approach to HTML and CSS development rests on a foundational understanding of
CSS&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property. I cannot overstate how important this concept is. As a quick
refresher, here&amp;#39;s to what I&amp;#39;m referring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.my-element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; is one of many possible values that can be assigned to an element&amp;#39;s
&lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property, we will focus on &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; (including &amp;quot;block-like&amp;quot;)
elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inline-elements&quot;&gt;Inline elements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inline elements can be simply described as &amp;quot;linear.&amp;quot; By default, they will take as much
horizontal space as necessary until reaching the maximum width allowed by their container,
at which point they will overflow into a line break (by default). Conceptually, inline
elements have no set height or width; instead, they will take up only the space that
they require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      alt=&quot;horizontal rectangles wrapping to two lines&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/inline.svg&quot;
      style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 350px;&quot;
    /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
        A representation of inline content wrapping to a new line
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;block-elements&quot;&gt;Block elements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block elements are not linear; in fact, they are rectangles. As such, they often behave
more intuitively than inline elements in the web browser, which is an inherently
two-dimensional medium. These types of elements are the ones that respect
the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model&quot;&gt;CSS box model&lt;/a&gt;:
they have defined width, height, positioning, and spacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      alt=&quot;horizontal rectangles wrapping to two lines&quot;

      style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 500px;&quot;
    /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
        The CSS Box Model.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;caveat-emptor&quot;&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that was simple, right? Inline is &lt;em&gt;like a line&lt;/em&gt; and block is &lt;em&gt;like a box&lt;/em&gt;. As a
reminder, though: there
are many other possible values for &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt;. A few possibilities include:
&lt;code&gt;inline-block&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;inline-flex&lt;/code&gt;.
These types of elements, however, will
generally fall under one of the two semantic categories we previously discussed.
According to the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#the-display-properties&quot;&gt;W3C spec&lt;/a&gt;, CSS3&amp;#39;s
&lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property is overloaded. There are &lt;em&gt;inner display types&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;outer display types&lt;/em&gt;. In most cases, your favorite &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; value is actually &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; on
the outside and something else on the inside (&lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt; is the poster child for this).
To complicate things further, there are six types of &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt;
values: outside, inside, listitem, internal, box, and legacy. Please feel free to spend
the rest of your day nerding out inside the W3C spec but we have a job to do, so
let&amp;#39;s move on. Suffice it to say that, despite the diversity in the CSS3 specification for
&lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt;, boiling down our process to &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; elements is sufficient for all
but the most arcane of edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inline-vs-block-idioms&quot;&gt;Inline vs. block idioms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said before that understanding inline vs. block is the foundational principle of this method.
Now let&amp;#39;s dive a little deeper into the types of properties that are idiomatic of these
elements, then we&amp;#39;ll unpack what this means for your user interface development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table id=&quot;idiomatic-properties-of-element-types&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Idiomatic properties of element types:&lt;/strong&gt;
      &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;
        Inline
      &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;
        Block
      &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;font*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;line-height&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;letter-spacing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;text-decoration&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;background-color&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bottom | left | right | top&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;margin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;padding&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;text-align&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what do we mean when we say &amp;quot;idiomatic?&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s not like you can&amp;#39;t declare a &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;
inside a block-level element, after all. The big idea to take away from this
not-at-all-exhaustive chart is that block-level elements should be selected for styles
that target properties of boxes, and inline-level elements should be selected for styles
that target properties of lines of content (usually text). Adding non-idiomatic
styles to a given element will create conditions that are ripe for having to go back
and fix something later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buttons-media-and-form-elements-are-block-elements&quot;&gt;Buttons, media, and form elements are block elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You heard me.  User agents typically give these types of elements specialized
&lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; values, but developers should be wary of passively accepting these
browser-assigned defaults.  Since we expect images, inputs, and videos to have
height, width, and to behave predictably in a layout that supports multiple screen
sizes, the only sensible course of action is to treat these elements as plain
ol&amp;#39; block elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      alt=&quot;CSS values displayed in the dev tools element inspector&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/ua-stylesheet.jpg&quot;
      style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 500px;&quot;
    /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
        Chromium 76 UA stylesheet values for an HTML button
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methodical-ui-in-seven-steps&quot;&gt;Methodical UI in seven steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our inline vs. block distinction fresh in our minds, let&amp;#39;s walk through seven steps
that will guide us through UI development using HTML and CSS with minimal frustration.
For the purposes of this example, I will be using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html&quot;&gt;React with JSX&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#39;s very similar to HTML so hopefully nothing gets lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-spec&quot;&gt;Example spec&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using this simple design comp as our &amp;quot;spec&amp;quot; to implement using our seven steps.
Behold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap&quot;&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 300px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Cat with text on a small screen&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/mobile-comp.jpg&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 300px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Cat with text on a large screen&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/desktop-comp.jpg&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;
      Ersatz design comp featuring my cat
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity&amp;#39;s sake, we won&amp;#39;t be listing all the different quantitative values like
&lt;code&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt; - just trust that we&amp;#39;re using the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; values in the following demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-content&quot;&gt;Step 1: Content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get all the content on the page, with the bare minimum of markup necessary.
Media tags and form element tags will be necessary, but nothing more - we
simply want to write no more HTML than is absolutely necessary to display
the elements with which we will be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./pepper.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Pepper'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Pepper
      Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
      long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
      that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
      joins almost all of them.
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'button'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Pet Pepper
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds simple, but your spec may contain dynamic content. If that is the case with
your feature, the least-disruptive choice would be to hardcode the most complex
content that is possible given the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By getting your final (or one possible version of the final) content all on the page, we
ensure that we are not forgetting anything.  Include any content
that is breakpoint-specific; if something is shown on wide screens but not small screens,
include it on the page here. We can work on media queries and hide/show logic later in
the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-semantics&quot;&gt;Step 2: Semantics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enclose content in semantic HTML tags.  Don&amp;#39;t worry about layout considerations -
this is where we add anchors, headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./pepper.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Pepper'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Pepper
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
        long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
        that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
        joins almost all of them.
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'button'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Pet Pepper
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we have enclosed the heading text inside an &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; tag and the copy text
inside a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag.  In so doing, we are making strides toward
valid and accessible markup.  These tags will be consistent across all breakpoints,
so there is no need to consider responsiveness at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-layout&quot;&gt;Step 3: Layout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is a bit more involved.  We will organize our semantic markup into the
appropriate layout-oriented tags in order to set ourselves up for success when
we begin adding stylesheets.  Identify which parts of your markup could be considered
headers, sections, footers, navigation elements, articles, etc. and wrap them
in the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Content_sectioning&quot;&gt;appropriate semantic HTML tag&lt;/a&gt;.
Be deliberate about choosing which tag to use, and feel free to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; if no
semantic purpose is evident.  Follow these directives for best results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the smallest supported screen width and don&amp;#39;t worry about CSS yet.  The
page will still look incomplete throughout this step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;media-markup&quot;&gt;Media&lt;/span&gt; and interactive elements such as images,
videos, inputs, and selects
must be wrapped in at least one &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;.  When in
doubt, use more wrappers than necessary.  Positioning media elements can be tricky
down the line, and you&amp;#39;ll be doing yourself a favor by giving yourself some containers
to work with, ensuring the best fit for your media on a variety of screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/foo.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- will be used to position the element in the document flow --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- will be used to constrain / crop / letterbox the media to the desired size --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/foo.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Foo&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Foo&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text nodes must be direct descendants of inline elements and must never be direct
descendants of block elements.  Remember that inline and block elements are fundamentally
different and should be styled as such.  We will style the text content using
a selector given to the &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; (inline) element, and we will style the box surrounding
that text via a selector assigned to the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; (block) element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Foo
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Foo
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For clarity&amp;#39;s sake, &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; is considered a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;text node&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#39;s
not quite an HTML element, but it is an entity inside the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt;.
When I refer to &lt;em&gt;text nodes&lt;/em&gt;, I simply am talking about text content inside
HTML elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibling elements should never have different &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; values.  In other words,
don&amp;#39;t put an &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; element next to a &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span id=&quot;button-markup&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; must have a direct
descendant that is a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;, and that &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; should
contain all content inside the button.  We will almost always position that &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;
absolutely so that the content of the button doesn&amp;#39;t produce any unexpected layout
changes.  In other words, we&amp;#39;re making sure if the button breaks, nothing
else will break as a result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Tap me
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Tap me
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s our source code so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./pepper.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                      Pet Pepper
                    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figures__figure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img
      loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      alt=&quot;screenshot of UI after step 3&quot;
      src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/wip.jpg&quot;
    /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
        Our UI after step 3
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is where we begin using CSS.  Word to the wise: &lt;strong&gt;target
the smallest supported screen size only&lt;/strong&gt; during this and subsequent
steps.  We will add styles for larger screen sizes eventually, but
this method works best when you complete your small-screen styles first
and then work your way up to the largest supported screen size.  This
encourages the developer to confine larger-screen styles inside media
query scopes, thus reducing the likelihood of having to modify
previously-written code that was working properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-style-inline-elements&quot;&gt;Step 4: Style inline elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the smallest supported screen size only, ensure all inline elements are
styled according to the specification.  Font properties, letter spacing,
line heights, and colors are all fair game.  The
&lt;a href=&quot;#idiomatic-properties-of-element-types&quot;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; earlier in this article
is a useful resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are targeting only these types of styles, it should become more
apparent why we enclose all text nodes inside a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;heading&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Hello world!
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.heading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;36px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;letter-spacing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By putting nine rules inside the &lt;code&gt;.heading&lt;/code&gt; selector, we have
obscured its purpose.  Both the descendant inline text node and
its containing &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; block are being styled and are therefore
coupled with one another unnecessarily.  We can resolve this issue
by adding a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recommended --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;heading&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text text--xl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Hello world!
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--xl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;36px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;letter-spacing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.heading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making our selectors more terse and separating the concerns of
inline vs block styles, we make the stylesheet more readable in a
way that suggests an intuitive markup structure.  In other words,
I can read the HTML and have a good clue as to what the CSS is like
and I can read the CSS and have a good clue as to what the HTML is
like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that principle in mind, let&amp;#39;s take a look at our source code
now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./pepper.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Pepper'&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-style-media-and-interactive-elements&quot;&gt;Step 5: Style media and interactive elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttons, images, videos, inputs, selects, and other types of interactive
elements aren&amp;#39;t inline elements, nor are they used to structure larger
layout patterns like some of the more conventional block elements.
Because these elements are so crucial to building web applications, they
can also be finicky and inconsistent from browser to browser.  Be sure to
follow the guidelines set forth earlier in this article with regard to
&lt;a href=&quot;#button-markup&quot;&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#media-markup&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; markup structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting down into the details of all the possibilities here might make this
already-long article even longer, so I will save that subtopic for a
future post.  Image/media positioning is a fairly well-tread subject in the
community so I&amp;#39;m confident you as the reader will navigate that successfully.
I would, however, like to get in a word about buttons.  As a refresher,
let&amp;#39;s take a look at a sample button:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;button__content-container&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text text--white text--sm&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Tap Me
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like an awful lot of pomp for a simple button.  But what happens
if we simplify it?  I mean, how bad could the following be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text text--white text--sm&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Tap Me
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in what happens with your dynamic content, and our conceptual
modeling of what a &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; actually represents.  Consider this set of styles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;appearance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#00f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;24px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--white&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would work fine for the time being.  But what happens if you change
the size of &lt;code&gt;.text--sm&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;16px&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;17px&lt;/code&gt;?  How would that affect the
rendered height of your &lt;code&gt;.button&lt;/code&gt; or the positioning of the text inside of
it?  Even if you are fluent in CSS, your code doesn&amp;#39;t make the answer clear
to the reader, which is a warning sign that you might end up inadvertently
breaking a layout down the line.  That&amp;#39;s why we have the extra &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; inside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;appearance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#00f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;24px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* wraps the text content */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button__content-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--white&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our &lt;code&gt;.button__content-container&lt;/code&gt; is absolutely positioned and
centered, any
change in its descendant elements will not affect the layout of &lt;code&gt;.button&lt;/code&gt;.
Whether it&amp;#39;s dynamic content or a change in font-size or spacing, the
absolutely-positioned container gives us an insurance policy against
accidental breakage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that note, let&amp;#39;s inspect our source code after step 5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pepper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./pepper.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-6-style-block-elements&quot;&gt;Step 6: Style block elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may notice that we have &amp;quot;started small.&amp;quot;  First, text nodes;
then, some larger and more complex elements.  This is intentional:
layouts cannot be adequately styled if their consituent elements
are not styled.  Many a developer, including myself, have tied
their shoelaces together by styling their layouts before locking down
the final dimensions of the content itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the smallest supported screen size&lt;/em&gt;, ensure your layout-oriented
block elements are styled with the appropriate values for positioning,
padding, margins, flex values, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button__btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:active&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button__content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your UI should now appear pixel-perfect on the smallest screen
size you support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 400px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Cat with text on a small screen&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/mobile-comp.jpg&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;
      Pepper on a small screen
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-7-repeat-for-each-breakpoint&quot;&gt;Step 7: Repeat for each breakpoint&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through
&lt;a href=&quot;#step-4-style-inline-elements&quot;&gt;step 4&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;#step-5-style-media-and-interactive-elements&quot;&gt;step 5&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&quot;#step-6-style-block-elements&quot;&gt;step 6&lt;/a&gt;
again at each specified breakpoint.  Our example spec has a
single breakpoint, but many designs will specify layouts for
mobile phone-sized screens, tablet-sized screens, laptop-sized
screens, and maybe one for extra-wide screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, since we are certain our styles for our smallest screen
work as expected, we can nest all subsequent styles inside a
media query and be confident that none of the work we&amp;#39;ve done
so far will be affected by this step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* approx. width of portrait-oriented tablet */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;screen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;768px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.text--sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* will not affect anything we've already done! 🎉 */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;18px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addPet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

                Pepper is a domestic shorthair.  This is funny because she has
                long hair in real life.  She enjoys being pet until she's done with
                that and bites me.  She also seems to like meetings, because she
                joins almost all of them.
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.button__container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;img
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
        style=&quot;display: block; max-height: 300px&quot;
        alt=&quot;Cat with text on a large screen&quot;
        src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/methodical-html-css-development/desktop-comp.jpg&quot;
      &gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;
      Pepper on a large screen
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve finished this process for all supported screen sizes,
the next step is up to your judgment.  If your content is dynamic,
you&amp;#39;ll want to make sure that your
dynamism is implemented and test your new UI with a
cross-section of possible content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you been checking your UI in multiple browsers throughout this
process?  If not, better fire up Safari and IE and get to work now
before you deploy your 🔥 HTML and CSS to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by incrementally turning raw content into idiomatic,
valid, and accessible markup.  Inline content was properly enclosed
in &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;s and/or other appropriate elements.  Block content was duly
enclosed in one of the many different types of tags that HTML5 gives
us for a number of purposes.  Block-like elements such as inputs
and images were coerced into becoming block elements with their own
purpose-driven, self-contained layouts within.  Support for
progressively wider screen sizes was incrementally added inside of
media query scopes so as to avoid introducing regressions into our
source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any simplified example, real-world workflows will necessarily
vary with the types of interfaces the developer is working on.  The
principles set forth in this article, though, will provide a sensible
guideline for safeguarding against common frustrations endemic
to front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-it-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping it up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am eager to
learn whether this process has helped anyone in real life, so please
don&amp;#39;t hesitate to reach out and start a dialogue on what&amp;#39;s working
and what isn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to acknolwedge
&lt;a href=&quot;http://josephalfonso.com/&quot;&gt;Joseph Alfonso&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s
contributions - his perspective helped to polish the prose
in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hillel Wayne: Modeling Redux with TLA+</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://jdauriemma.com/assets/images/featured/tla.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hillel Wayne: Modeling Redux with TLA+&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A colleague that I met in a regional tech community, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hillelwayne.com&quot;&gt;Hillel Wayne&lt;/a&gt;, recently solicited some feedback on the Redux portions of this informative piece on using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B&quot;&gt;TLA+&lt;/a&gt; to model &lt;a href=&quot;https://redux.js.org/&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt;.  I obliged him, and learned a lot about TLA+ in the process!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth a read:&lt;/p&gt;
