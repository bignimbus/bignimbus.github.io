"So, what's your work from home policy?" During my last job search, I'd ask recruiters and hiring managers this question pretty early on.  I liked going into the office regularly, but I also liked working from home when it made sense to do so.  The answers ranged from "I don't know" (red flag) to "not unless you're sick" (because you are in meetings all day every day?) to "we're flexible as long as you are productive."  The last answer was the most encouraging, because it showed that the company had or at least aspired to a structured release cycle with few surprises.  [Opternative](https://opternative.com) was one of those companies, and they proved me right.  I've been there for one year, and hope to be there for many more.  Recently, my family relocated to northern New Jersey.  Instead of leaving my role as an Opternative software engineer, the company and I decided to try the first 100% remote position in the company's three-year history.  Transitioning from working in their Chicago office to my home office in northern New Jersey was bittersweet.  I hope that, in reading about my experience so far, other employers and employees might gain some insight into how to transition from an in-office to all-remote arrangement.

## The office life (before)

[Opternative's very hip office](http://www.builtinchicago.org/2016/06/22/chicago-tech-gets-outside-during-workday) in West Loop, Chicago is surprisingly quiet for an open-plan co-working type layout.  Usually the loudest thing you hear ringing off the super-high ceilings is the occasional laughter at a well-played `/giphy` in our Slack team.  It was a really nice environment, and I enjoyed being there.  My coworkers are really great people with whom I genuinely enjoy spending time.  The _gratis_ Intelligentsia coffee and catered lunches didn't hurt, either.

## The home office life (after)

My not-really-that-hip office is located in suburban northern New Jersey.  My commute from the kitchen after eating breakfast is a trip up the stairs to the room at the end of the hall.  Right now it's pretty barren: a large bookshelf, a drawer, and two [World Market Josephine Desks](http://www.worldmarket.com/product/josephine-desk.do) (his and hers).  We haven't bought office chairs or a rug for this room yet, so I'm currently parking it on a dining chair lifted from downstairs.  The coffee situation is different: we have a cheap Gaggia semi-automatic espresso machine downstairs stocked with La Columbe beans.

## Hardware and software makes it happen

The Opternative team is highly active on [Slack](https://slack.com/) - it's the hub of most of our communication (this was true even when I was in the office).  Not much has changed in that respect - I still feel linked to the company because I am still engaged with our Slack.  Of course, some interactions are best done face-to-face in real time.

We use Google Apps at Opternative, so all scheduled meetings are generated with a Google Hangouts link.  When it's meeting time, I click the link to the Hangout, put on my headset.  On the other end, we have two large TVs with webcams and bluetooth microphones run through a [Chromebox](https://www.amazon.com/Asus-CHROMEBOX-M004U-ASUS-Desktop/dp/B00IT1WJZQ).  For standups, one of the Chicago teammates uses their laptop or phone to call into the Hangout and "stand up" with those who are working from home.  The office broadband connection is currently stretched to its limits with a fast-growing team, so that has left the experience less than optimal, but totally do-able.

For pair programming, we use an app called Screenhero, which lives up to its name 100%.  Seriously, I am in love with Screenhero.  It is a real-time VOIP application that is built for screensharing and interacting.  Person A shares their screen with Person B, and both people can interact with Person A's computer.  Helping a teammate debug a problem is way simpler when both parties can interact.  For smaller, one-on-one sessions like this, Opternative has a small "phone booth" room in the office to minimize distractions in the coworking space.

Making these modest changes to our team norms has facilitated my transition to 100% remote work, but also has helped the entire team stay connected when working from home on occassion.
