I've been writing software for Chicago-based [Opternative](https://opternative.com) for one year, and hope to be there for many more.  Recently, my family relocated to northern New Jersey.  Instead of parting ways, the company and I decided to try the first 100% remote position in the Opternative's three-year history.  Transitioning from being on-site to 100% remote was a big change, but so far it's been a success.  I hope that this post helps other employers and employees gain some insight into the kinds of adjustments to expect when considering a new remote working relationship.

## Office life: before

[Opternative's very hip office](http://www.builtinchicago.org/2016/06/22/chicago-tech-gets-outside-during-workday) in West Loop, Chicago is surprisingly quiet for an open-plan co-working type layout.  Usually the loudest thing you hear ringing off the super-high ceilings is the occasional laughter at a well-played `/giphy` in our Slack team.  It was a really nice environment, and I enjoyed being there.  My coworkers are really great people with whom I genuinely enjoy spending time.  The _gratis_ Intelligentsia coffee and catered lunches didn't hurt, either.

## Office life: after

My not-really-that-hip office is located in suburban northern New Jersey.  My commute from the kitchen after eating breakfast is a trip up the stairs to the room at the end of the hall.  Right now it's pretty barren: a large bookshelf, a drawer, and two [World Market Josephine Desks](http://www.worldmarket.com/product/josephine-desk.do) (his and hers).  We haven't bought office chairs or a rug for this room yet, so I'm currently parking it on a dining chair lifted from downstairs.  The coffee situation is different: we have a cheap Gaggia semi-automatic espresso machine downstairs stocked with La Columbe beans.

## Meetings and pair programming: before

Opternative is good at keeping software engineers working on software, so meetings are thoughtfully scheduled and rarely too numerous.  Typically a meeting would take place in one of a handful of conference rooms.  Those who happened to be working from home joined via Google Hangouts, usually via one of the other attendee's computers. Audio and video quality depended on how the camera was positioned and how close people were to the microphone.  It's safe to say that those who weren't there in person got the low-fi version of the meeting.

Pair programming has been an increasingly important part of our culture.  Typically speaking, if you weren't in the office then you weren't pair programming.  But if you were, we'd simply plop down on a couch or in a conference room and pair program.  Simple.

## Meetings and pair programming: after

All of our conference rooms already had TVs in them, so upgrading our A/V setup for meetings was pretty simple. We recently invested in webcams and bluetooth microphones run through [Chromeboxes](https://www.amazon.com/Asus-CHROMEBOX-M004U-ASUS-Desktop/dp/B00IT1WJZQ) for all conference areas.  For standups, one of the Chicago teammates uses their laptop or phone to call into the Hangout and "stand up" with those who are working from home.  The office broadband connection is currently stretched to its limits with a fast-growing team, so that has left the experience less than optimal, but much more hi-fi than before.

For pair programming, we have embraced an app called [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/), which lives up to its name 100%.  Seriously, I am in love with Screenhero.  It is a real-time VOIP application that is built for screensharing and interacting.  Person A shares their screen with Person B, and both people can interact with Person A's computer.  Helping a teammate debug a problem is way simpler when both parties can interact.  For smaller, one-on-one sessions like this, Opternative has a small "phone booth" room in the office to minimize distractions in the coworking space.

## Team interactions: before

Our team does a lot together.  Rooftop parties, spin class, and hanging out over a free catered lunch every day are some of our favorite pastimes.  In addition, the Opternative team is highly active on [Slack](https://slack.com/) - it's the hub of most of our impromptu communication.  We also make judicious use of Google Drive, Basecamp, Dropbox and Trello for sharing files, plans, and ideas.

## Team interactions: after

Unfortunately I'm no longer able to enjoy free lunches and rooftop shenanigans with my coworkers, but I see at least a few coworkers' faces every day thanks to Google Hangouts, and I was never at a loss for words on Slack.  Between those tools and the already rich paper trail offered by our use of cloud services, my interactions with the Opternative team still contribute to a positive, productive working environment in "both" offices.

## Wrapping it up

Making these modest changes to our team norms has facilitated my transition to 100% remote work, but also has helped the entire team stay connected when working from home on occassion.
