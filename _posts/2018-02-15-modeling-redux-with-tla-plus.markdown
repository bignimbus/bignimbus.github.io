A colleague that I met in a regional tech community, [Hillel Wayne](https://www.hillelwayne.com), recently solicited some feedback on the Redux portions of this informative piece on using [TLA+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B) to model [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).  I obliged him, and learned a lot about TLA+ in the process!

It's worth a read:
