<h4>How to Write a Really Boring Music Blog</h4>
<p>When I started this blog a few weeks ago, I resolved to blog about all my interests, not just programming. This obviously presents a challenge: holding an audience whilst writing about a wide variety of mostly unrelated subjects. I love listening to and composing music, so my first thought was to regularly write music reviews and occasionally post an original composition whenever I feel like writing one. Both of those options now seem really uninteresting and offer nothing new in terms of interesting content.</p>
<p>The question lingered: how do I blog about music in a way that''s potentially interesting to myself and my intended audience (the internet)? The answer is around 300 years old. I am a huge Bach fan. Not only do I like listening to his music, I also enjoy composing polyphonic music that imitates Bach''s style. I have composed more than a handful of fugues (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue">what''s a fugue?</a>) in my life and some of them have turned out halfway decent. These fugues are also completely uninteresting to everyone else except music theory nerds.</p>
<p>But lots of people like rap and pop music, so what if I could marry my interest in composing in a centuries-old idiom without boring everyone to death? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...</p>
<h4>If Bach Wrote...</h4>

<p>This series will be a semi-regular (monthly maybe?) series in which I take a given Top 40 Song, extract melodies from that song, and compose a fugue based on that melody. The title will always be: "If Bach Wrote... [Song Title]." Without further ado:</p>
<h3>If Bach Wrote "Turn Down for What"</h3>
<p>Lil Jon and DJ Snake released "Turn Down for What" in late 2013 and has since gone platinum and hit #1 on two US Billboard charts. It also has a synthesizer ostinato that is absolutely entrancing:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://jdauriemma.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/turndownclip.mp3">Synth Line</a></li></ul><p>This synth ostinato will serve as the fugue's <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/tas3/fugueanatomy.html">subject</a>. I simplified the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncopation">syncopation</a> in the rhythm in order to accommodate the Baroque idiom:</p>

<p>I am using a <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/tas3/fugueanatomy.html">"tonal answer"</a> that is a bit unconventional:</p>
<p><a href="http://jdauriemma.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/turndown02.jpg"><img alt="Tonal answer in G minor: ii-dim" class="size-full wp-image-102" src="http://jdauriemma.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/turndown02.jpg"></a><br><em>Tonal answer in E minor: iio - (v)</em></p>
<p>Most fugues in the minor mode opt for a tonal answer in the relative major or dominant; this, however, answers in the submediant. The piece wastes little time progressing into the development section after the third voice restates the subject. Here is the full audio:</p>
