```
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around
And desert you
- Stock Aitken Waterman, as performed by Rick Astley
```

Just the other day, my colleague, Dan, changed our conference call hold music to Rick Astley's 1987 hit, "Never Gonna Give You Up."  This filled me with joy because Dan didn't know that I've been sitting on this composition for the better part of two years.  A new job and a new child later, and I've finally gotten to finish "If Bach Wrote.... Never Gonna Give You Up."  I take great pleasure in being able to do a completely original Rick Roll of the internet.

### About this series
For those who aren't familiar, this piece is part of a series of fugues called [If Bach Wrote]({{ site.url }}/tag/ifbachwrote).  The premise is simple: extract a memorable tune (or tunes) from pop music with minimal alteration, and write a [fugue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue) with that tune as the [subject](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/tas3/fugueanatomy.html).

### Analysis
This is a three-voice fugue in the key that Astley sang it: A-flat major (!?).  I made one key modification: the [time signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature).  Instead of the standard 4/4 time signature, I opted to go with 3/8.  It just sounds more like a Baroque dance this way, and allowed me to take advantage of the "bouncy" nature of the rhythms.

#### Themes
I chose the melody of the chorus as a subject:

  <figcaption>bass clef; Ab major</figcaption>
