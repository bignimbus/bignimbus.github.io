```

"Just a small town girl  

Living in a lonely world  

She took the midnight train  

Going anywhere"  

          -Journey  

```

Admit it, you were singing along! Not to dismiss the importance of good lyrics, I've always been more attached to melodies, harmonies and bass lines than lead vocals; I learned all the notes in this song long before I knew all the words. Whether you love Journey's lyrics, instrumentals, or hate Journey entirely, I hope that you enjoy this version of "If Bach Wrote."

### Welcome back...

To the second installment of [If Bach Wrote...](http://jdauriemma.com/blog/tag/if-bach-wrote/) (IBW). If Bach Wrote... (IBW) is a personal project of mine where I regularly pick an iconic tune from pop culture, extract melodic material from it, and compose a [fugue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue) with that melody as the [subject](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/tas3/fugueanatomy.html).

A handful of weeks ago I did a [polyphonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony) treatment of Lil Jon and DJ Snake's ["Turn Down for What"](http://jdauriemma.com/blog/if-bach-wrote-turn-down-for-what/) and was pleasantly surprised by the number of hits it got. People more or less had nice things to say about it, too. So, if you listened: thank you!

### Original

First, you may want to [view the score](#score). I'm convinced that all American citizens have this song tattooed on their brains, but just in case you want to hear it ooooone moooore tiiiiime, here's a link to the [original recording](https://youtu.be/1k8craCGpgs). I decided to take the left-hand half of the piano part from the intro as this fugue's subject and [answer](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/tas3/fugueanatomy.html).

In notation:

Subject, in E major: I V vi IV

Tonal Answer, in E major: V ii-V42 IV V6

This fugue makes use of two [countersubjects](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/tas3/fugueanatomy.html):

![Countersubject 1](http://jdauriemma.startlogic.com/home/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-01-at-5.25.36-PM.png)

Countersubject 1

![Countersubject 2](http://jdauriemma.startlogic.com/home/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-01-at-5.25.55-PM.png)

Countersubject 2, free counterpoint thereafter

You may notice that Countersubject sounds a tiny bit like the right-hand piano part of the song - this was unintentional but welcome.

The exposition is strict with very little free counterpoint, so it's over fairly quickly for a four-voice fugue. The development begins in measure 17\. The subject is stated many times throughout the piece per se, in simplified rhythms, [augmented](http://composerstoolbox.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/tool-17-augmentation-and-diminution/), and [inverted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music)). I am particularly proud of measures 49-59, where the subject is iterated concurrently per se and in augmentation.

The tonal outline of the piece is:

*   (mm1) E major
*   (mm~25) C# minor
*   (mm35) A major
*   (mm41) F# minor
*   (mm45) A major
*   (mm49) D major
*   (mm53) C# minor (Not quite what Bach would do, but I couldn't resist)
*   (mm60) E major
