<p>Admit it, you were singing along! Not to dismiss the importance of good lyrics, I've always been more attached to melodies, harmonies and bass lines than lead vocals; I learned all the notes in this song long before I knew all the words. Whether you love Journey's lyrics, instrumentals, or hate Journey entirely, I hope that you enjoy this version of "If Bach Wrote."</p><h4>If Bach Wrote... Don't Stop Believin'</h4>

</p><h4>Welcome back...</h4>
<p>To the second installment of <a href="http://jdauriemma.com/blog/tag/if-bach-wrote/">If Bach Wrote...</a> (IBW). If Bach Wrote... (IBW) is a personal project of mine where I regularly pick an iconic tune from pop culture, extract melodic material from it, and compose a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue">fugue</a> with that melody as the <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/tas3/fugueanatomy.html">subject</a>.</p>
<p>A handful of weeks ago I did a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony">polyphonic</a> treatment of Lil Jon and DJ Snake's <a href="http://jdauriemma.com/blog/if-bach-wrote-turn-down-for-what/">"Turn Down for What"</a> and was pleasantly surprised by the number of hits it got. People more or less had nice things to say about it, too. So, if you listened: thank you!</p>
<h4>Original</h4>
<p>First, you may want to <a href="#score">view the score</a>. I'm convinced that all American citizens have this song tattooed on their brains, but just in case you want to hear it ooooone moooore tiiiiime, here's a link to the <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Don+t+Stop+Believin/3WbLGn?src=5">original recording</a>. I decided to take the left-hand half of the piano part from the intro as this fugue's subject and <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/tas3/fugueanatomy.html">answer</a>.

<img alt="IBW Don't Stop Believin Answer" class="size-full wp-image-494" src="http://jdauriemma.startlogic.com/home/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-01-at-5.16.18-PM.png"></p><p>Tonal Answer, in E major: V ii-V42 IV V6</p>
<p>This fugue makes use of two <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/tas3/fugueanatomy.html">countersubjects</a>:</p>
<img alt="Countersubject 1" src="http://jdauriemma.startlogic.com/home/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-01-at-5.25.36-PM.png"><p>Countersubject 1</p>
<img alt="Countersubject 2" src="http://jdauriemma.startlogic.com/home/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-01-at-5.25.55-PM.png"><p>Countersubject 2, free counterpoint thereafter</p>
<p>You may notice that Countersubject sounds a tiny bit like the right-hand piano part of the song - this was unintentional but welcome.</p>
<p>The exposition is strict with very little free counterpoint, so it's over fairly quickly for a four-voice fugue. The development begins in measure 17. The subject is stated many times throughout the piece per se, in simplified rhythms, <a href="http://composerstoolbox.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/tool-17-augmentation-and-diminution/">augmented</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music)">inverted</a>. I am particularly proud of measures 49-59, where the subject is iterated concurrently per se and in augmentation.</p>
<p>The tonal outline of the piece is:</p>
<ul><li>(mm1) E major</li>
<li>(mm~25) C# minor</li>
<li>(mm35) A major</li>
<li>(mm41) F# minor</li>
<li>(mm45) A major</li>
<li>(mm49) D major</li>
<li>(mm53) C# minor (Not quite what Bach would do, but I couldn't resist)
</li><li>(mm60) E major</li>
