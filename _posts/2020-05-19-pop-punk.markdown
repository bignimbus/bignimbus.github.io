excerpt: A brief introduction of my first vim color scheme

I've been using the vim text editor for a while now.  I
know some basic
[vimscript](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/),
but not much more.  A while ago, I settled on a version of
the [cobalt](https://github.com/gkjgh/cobalt) color scheme
as my theme of choice.  I made a few tweaks here and there
over the course of a few years.  It started to become more
noticeably painful to change colors after a while - sometimes
I'd update a hex color and forget to update the corresponding
cterm value.  And as I got deeper into customizing my terminal,
I got deeper into tweaking my vim setup.  So I decided it was
high time to solidify all the tweaks I made into a coherent
color scheme (with a matching airline theme).

So, here's
[pop-punk.vim](https://github.com/bignimbus/pop-punk.vim):
a dark, high-contrast color scheme that retains a sense of
fun and character.  If you're a vim user, I'd love to hear
what you think of it!
